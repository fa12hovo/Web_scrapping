Brock Purdy ate one at his locker before the Super Bowl. Andy Reid once offered them to his players as a reward. Before practice, during training camp and in the halftime locker room, they are a favorite of players across the NFL, a touch of childhood wrapped in plastic.
A few years ago The Athletic wrote about orange slices, the NFL’s secret halftime snack (fun fact: teams are required to provide “three dozen sliced oranges for halftime” for the visiting team). But in the course of reporting that story, many players said they passed on halftime citrus in favor of something else: Uncrustables, the sealed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches found in the frozen aisle of your local supermarket — and apparently permeating the NFL.

At the end of the 2023 season, The Athletic endeavored to find out just how many Uncrustables the league actually eats. And after convincing team employees that this was in fact a real question and not another scam message, most teams agreed to pony up their data from last year. A handful declined to participate, and a few others said they were PB&J purists who made their own sandwiches.
But based on the information collected, it’s safe to say that NFL teams go through anywhere from 3,600 to 4,300 Uncrustables a week. When you factor in training camps and the teams that did not share their data, NFL teams easily go through at least 80,000 Uncrustables a year.
Weekly Uncrustable consumption across the NFL
Note: 24 of 32 NFL teams provided The Athletic with approximate ranges for weekly Uncrustables eaten. The graphic represents the highest amount each team eats in a week.

Len Kretchman, a former wide receiver at North Dakota State, lived in the small town of Fergus Falls, Minn., and worked with schools in the food service industry. Sometime in the mid-90s, Len said, his wife, Emily, suggested he create a mass-produced peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the crust.
The project appealed to Len’s business instinct: a simple idea with a complex logistical problem to solve. The Kretchmans started in their kitchen with a loaf of bread, one jar of peanut butter, one jar of jelly and a few drinks.
“We’re not recreating the atomic bomb here,” Len said. “We’re trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich … It was two people standing there, goofing off, probably having a beer and a glass of wine and saying, ‘What do you think of this?'”
The first decision they made was that the sandwich should be round.
“The moon is round, the sun is round, the Earth is round, it’s our favorite shape,” Len said. “Do you have to go to a committee and survey people on what the shape should be? No. It’s round. So we got that nailed down.”
Secrets behind the NFL’s favorite sandwich
Kitchen-counter to mass production
Founder Len Kretchman’s wife, Emily, suggested commercializing the snack, which got its iconic round shape from initially being cut out using a drinking glass.
Innovative technique
Putting the jelly in the middle and covering it with the peanut butter turned out to be the key to protecting the jelly from leaking.
What’s in a name?
The original name of the product, “The Incredible Uncrustable,” was coined by an 11-year-old boy whose father was involved in the business.
Next, he grabbed a cup from his kitchen cabinet.
“If you asked moms how they (took the crust off a sandwich) 30 years ago, they’d say: ‘I found a glass in my cupboard that was the right dimension and I pressed on the bread and I cut the crust off,'” Kretchman said. “And that’s what we did!”
They added a crimp to the edges of the crustless bread, which was easy, but then had to figure out how to keep the jelly from oozing, which was not. Every time they thawed their creations, the jelly bled into the bread and ruined the sandwich. Much trial and error followed.
“We finally put the blob of jelly in the middle of the bread and then covered it with peanut butter and encased the jelly so it doesn’t leach into the bread,” Kretchman said. “That was key. That was our gee-whiz moment.”
We’re not recreating the atomic bomb here... we’re trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Kretchman and his business partner, David Geske, pitched their product to local schools. They needed a name. Once again, the idea landed in their kitchen. They asked the 11-year-old son of a business associate for a suggestion. His answer: The Incredible Uncrustable. Four years later, in 1999, Smuckers bought the company, dropped the first part of the name and introduced the country to the Uncrustable.
It took a little time, but the NFL wasn’t far behind.
The Uncrustables eaten by the NFL in one year would cover over 18 yards of a football field
They weren’t there when former Pro Bowl tight end Dallas Clark was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 2003. Of that much he’s certain. But the moment this new treat joined the food ranks with “all that other healthy crap” the Colts provided? He can’t really say.
All that he remembers is the feeling that something beautiful had happened.

“It’s up there with the cell phone where you’re like, ‘How is this done?'” Clark said. “When they came out it was like, ‘Duh, why did someone not think of this a looong time ago?'”
It was Jon Torine’s job to stock those snacks, “healthy crap” and all, for the Colts. And it was an especially important job during the week of the Super Bowl in 2007 when the Colts played the Chicago Bears in Miami. In the hotel ballroom where the team stayed, Torine, the Colts’ strength and conditioning coach at the time, laid out a spread for players to grab and go as they moved from meeting to meeting.
You could throw your playbook on top of ’em, didn’t make any difference. Squished, unsquished, you’re gonna crush it.
“We were all scoopin’ and scorin’,” said Jeff Saturday, a center on that team. “We were grabbing five, six at a time.”
Clark, a player who struggled to keep on weight, would throw them in his backpack, unbothered by what would happen to them once there. “The Uncrustables always found their way to the bottom and got smashed by the playbook,” he said. “But still edible. Still in one compartment.”
“Didn’t matter,” Saturday said. “You could throw your playbook on top of ’em, didn’t make any difference. Squished, unsquished, you’re gonna crush it.”
They are now a staple for many NFL teams. San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle eats two on flights to road games and anywhere from two to four on flights home. Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna eats them at the team facility and at home. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker grabs one from the snack table on his way to meetings. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce claimed on his podcast that he eats more of them than “anything else in the world.”
“We’re all creatures of habit, dude,” Saturday said. “Almost freakishly. If you’re a two-Uncrustables-a-day kind of guy, that’s just what you do.”
Each week, the NFL consumes nearly the weight of three Travis Kelces in Uncrustables
Torine and most nutritionists wouldn’t recommend frozen, processed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as their No. 1 healthy snack option for players. But Uncrustables can do the job, especially when time is limited, and even nutritionists at the highest level of sports performance make compromises.

The bread and jelly give players quick carbohydrates. The peanut butter provides a little fat and a little protein. They’re easy to digest, convenient to eat and a comfort food that players love (though there is wide disagreement as to whether grape or strawberry is the better jelly flavor — the correct answer is strawberry).
In fact, the Colts also ate Uncrustables at halftime of Super Bowl XLI, when they beat the Bears 29-17.
“So maybe that was the difference,” Torine said, laughing.

ASHBURN, Va. — His alarm buzzes at 4:45 each morning, but most days Jayden Daniels doesn’t need it. He’s already awake, driving through the predawn darkness, pulling into an empty parking lot at 21300 Coach Gibbs Dr. The routine he started his final year at LSU has become a staple of his rookie season in the NFL.

“You always here this early?” Adam Peters asked after bumping into Daniels in the hallway around 5:30 a.m. a few weeks ago. Peters, the Commanders’ first-year general manager, was headed to the weight room. Daniels was about to watch some film.
“Usually, it’s a little earlier,” Daniels told him. “But I had to make an extra stop today.”
Peters looked down. Daniels was holding two boxes of donuts, gifts for his offensive linemen.
For a while, his teammates didn’t know he was showing up so early; Daniels studies with the door shut and doesn’t tell anyone he’s there. But in time, the car that kept beating them to the building, day after day, week after week, started to tell them something. A few started to wonder: is it normal for a quarterback to show up this early?
“Not normal for most,” says linebacker Bobby Wagner, a 13-year veteran bound for the Hall of Fame. “Normal for the great ones.”
After Washington took Daniels second in April’s draft, the team’s new center, Tyler Biadasz, figured he’d start coming in early to work with the rookie on exchanges. He showed up at 6 one morning and realized he was late. Daniels was already on the practice field, repping that day’s walkthrough. Alone.
GO DEEPER
Jayden Daniels' growth with VR simulation has Commanders embracing mind games
Terry McLaurin knew after his first practice. Daniels hadn’t been on the field 15 minutes — hadn’t been in the building a week — and he was already making checks at the line of scrimmage. Then the rookie made a throw that cut through the teeth of the defense, a throw McLaurin remembers in detail five months later.
“Here’s why this play is different,” the sixth-year Pro Bowl wideout says. “The receiver’s running a crosser, and most guys wait to release it until he clears the hook defender in the middle of the field. They wait until that window opens up, you know?
“Jayden threw it before there even was a window. I’ve never seen a rookie do that.”

Linebacker Frankie Luvu was on the field that day. He saw the throw. He knew, too.
“We gotta get our s— right on defense,” he told himself, “because we got ourselves a quarterback.”
A quarterback? This team? After churning through 27 starters and 10 coaches during the Dan Snyder era — winning just two playoff games in 24 years — as one of the NFL’s proud franchises dissolved into dysfunction?
There were league investigations and Congressional hearings. Leaked emails. The name change. The railing collapse. RGIII’s knee. Cover-ups. Lawsuits. And losing. Years and years of losing.
“I’ve seen this place from afar, and there was always this black cloud over it,” says Washington tight end Zach Ertz, who spent eight-plus years beating up on the franchise as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. “This was an organization that always had talent, but you were never worried about them long-term.
“With new leadership, a guy like Jayden, the right group around him … this city has waited for this.”
Still, this is a scarred franchise and a scarred fan base trying to shake that lingering fear that’s been beaten into them for 30 years.
Paul Walker is 65. He’s wearing a burgundy Sonny Jurgensen No. 9, tailgating ahead of the Commanders’ Week 7 meeting with the Panthers. “My first game in person since the Monday Night Massacre,” he says, referring to the night 14 years ago when Eagles quarterback Michael Vick torched Washington for six touchdowns in a 59-28 win. “We always got that mentality that something’s eventually gonna go wrong. It just always has.
“But I’m telling you, this season is bringing me back to the Joe Gibbs years. Our quarterback might be the best one we’ve had since …”
Walker pauses, then points to his chest, to Jurgensen’s No. 9.
Rob Abelman fell in love with football during the Gibbs years. He used to tag along with his dad to games at RFK Stadium, and he watched two Super Bowl wins in person. Then he got so fed up with the team during Snyder’s run that he canceled his season tickets.

The minute he read Snyder was selling the team, he signed up for new ones. “I have the belief because I’ve seen it,” says Abelman, who with his son, Jared, drives in from Philadelphia for games. “(Jared) doesn’t. He’s 24. All he’s known his whole life is heartbreak.”
Sunday spoke to both. A 40-7 romp over Carolina — the NFC East-leading Commanders’ fifth win in six weeks — was tinged by Daniels’ first-quarter exit. It’s a rib injury, not expected to be anything serious, but a reminder nonetheless for a fan base trying to convince itself it’s allowed to believe again.
Hope remains a dangerous thing in the District.
It started with an arena league quarterback drilling his dropbacks on an empty field just west of the San Bernardino Mountains. Ryan Porter was mid-sweat when Jay Daniels walked out of the YMCA across the street, recognized him, and asked if he’d ever considered coaching. Porter shook his head.
“But I guess I could,” he finally said.
“Cool, we’ll be here tomorrow,” Jay told him. “I have a son who plays quarterback.”
By that point, Jay had pushed his 12-year-old to think about a different position. Jayden was long and lean, always the fastest kid on the field. “What about wide receiver?” dad would ask. “Or cornerback?” Jay had played the latter in college, first at Washington, then Iowa State, and to him it was merely a numbers game. “Way more opportunities to get on the field,” he’d argue.
The conversation kept coming up. The two kept going back and forth.
“Dad,” Jayden always shot back, “I’m a quarterback.”
“He was hell-bent,” his father says now.
So it was settled. Jay wouldn’t fight his son’s ambitions; he’d nurture them.
The first thing he did was warn Jayden. “You’re gonna have to live in chaos,” dad said. “If you can live in chaos, then you can do this.” They’d spend hours on YouTube, poring through old games, studying some of the best to ever play the position. Jay wanted his son watching Joe Montana, because Joe Montana never lost his cool. “Look at his face,” he’d tell Jayden. “His expression never changes.”
Advertisement
A hard lesson came early, and it stuck: Jayden was 7, playing defense in the Pop Warner championship, and he was beat around the edge for a touchdown. He looked up at his father, about to burst into tears. “Don’t cry,” Jay pleaded. “It’s just one play.”
He knew if the team’s best player lost it, everyone else would, too. The tears spilled out. The whole team followed. “The game was never close after that,” Jay says.
That afternoon — and what it taught Jayden — has stayed with him ever since. He built an unflappability into his game, refusing to get rattled. He knows teammates are watching, and teammates will follow.
Jay had always been a football junkie; his son became one too. They’d watch college games on Saturdays and the NFL on Sundays. They’d watch day after day of the scouting combine, then the entire NFL Draft. Porter, who would work with Jayden through high school, learned something early on: this wasn’t just a hobby, and it wasn’t just a sport.
“I call it an unhealthy obsession,” the coach says. “Not one time did Jayden ask, ‘Hey, are my two hours up?’ He was there to get better. He was never bored. He was just in love with this thing called quarterback.”
Jay would send over videos from Jayden’s U-14 games. “OK, we got the zone read and RPO bubble down,” he’d write. “What’s next?” Porter realized he could teach Jayden a drill and never have to repeat himself. He’d see a nod, hear “Mmmhmmm” and nothing more.
During workouts, Porter worked the feet more than he worked the arm. The smooth dropbacks Jayden employs now in burgundy and gold — the big five, rhythm five, flash give, seven step, one-step bounce — were first honed on that empty field across from the San Bernardino YMCA. Jayden saw progress through thousands of reps.
“Your eyes control your feet, and your feet control your arm,” Porter kept telling him. He never once tinkered with Jayden’s mechanics. He saw no need. “It’s like a slingshot,” Porter says. “Throwing a football for somebody like Jayden Daniels is a very natural thing. The minute I make it unnatural, I’ve failed him as a coach.”

Jayden’s talents blossomed at Cajon High in San Bernardino, where his parents had to sign a waiver to allow him to play varsity as a freshman. “He was maybe 130 pounds,” Jay says. The Cowboys were state champs three years later. From there the spotlight began to swell, just as Jay had warned, and Jayden wrestled with the rigors of being a star quarterback. The pressure mounted his senior year: Everyone wanted five touchdowns a game, another state title, and, most of all, his college decision.
Jay saw it on his son’s face at halftime of Cajon’s playoff opener that fall. Jayden was playing lousy. He looked overwhelmed. Walking into the locker room, coaches kept pulling him aside, pointing out mistakes. The weight of it all, the hype, the expectations — he was a 17-year-old kid shouldering too much.
“Say something to him,” Jay told Porter, who by that point was an assistant at Cajon.
So while Jayden warmed up before the third quarter, Porter pulled out his phone and showed him a picture. In it, Jayden was 12 years old, smiling ear to ear, doing his favorite thing in the world: playing football. “Forget all this BS right now,” Porter told him. “I just need you to be this kid.”
While Jayden stared at the photo, a tear trickled down his cheek. He threw three touchdowns after halftime. Cajon won 39-7 and made its way back to the state title game.
Three years later, another decision beckoned: after a sterling start at Arizona State, Daniels struggled as a junior, tossing as many interceptions (10) as touchdowns. What few knew at the time: how much heartache he’d been forced to bottle up inside.
The winter before, in a span of three weeks, he lost two grandparents to COVID-19. His grandfather’s passing hit hardest: Jay’s dad had passed football down to him, and Jay had passed it down to Jayden. Jayden and his grandfather had spoken the night before. “I love you,” his grandpa told him. It’d be the last thing Jayden ever heard him say.

“Man, that took a toll on both of us,” his father says now. “He carried a heavy load that season.”
Meanwhile, the NCAA was digging into ASU’s program for alleged recruiting violations. Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach Daniels had come to Tempe to play for, was on his way out. The quarterback sought a bigger stage to finish his college career and an offense better suited to his strengths. He decided to transfer. His phone started blowing up.
Daniels decided he wouldn’t demand the starting job at his next stop, and his top choice, LSU, wasn’t offering it. He’d arrive as the fourth QB on the depth chart.
Jay stepped aside and let his son make the decision.
“High risk, high reward,” Jayden told him. “If I can’t make it at LSU, then I don’t deserve to be in the NFL one day.”
“You’re gonna hate me,” Sherman Wilson texted him.
It was December 2022. Daniels had decided to return to LSU for his fifth and final college season, and Wilson, the Tigers’ director of player retention, wanted him to know what the next few months were going to look like.
Wilson had been goading the quarterback for weeks while he weighed entering the draft. “If you wanna be a fourth-round pick, fine,” Wilson wrote at one point. “But you have more to do here.”
Once Daniels decided to stay, Wilson became his corner man, Bundini Brown in his ear. Instead of shouting at him ringside, Wilson texted incessantly. Bible verses. Motivational stories. Barbs to seep under Daniels’ skin. Wilson knew he hadn’t come close to reaching his potential in Baton Rouge.
“You succeed in September by preparing in January,” Wilson wrote.
“Don’t act like you wanna be the best if you’re not willing to do what others aren’t.”
“I hope you’re ready, because you’re not gonna see your family after spring break.”
For Daniels, everything changed. He’d think like a pro, study like a pro, work like a pro. The first thing he did was sit down with LSU’s coaching staff and tick through a series of questions he wanted answered. Among them: “What’s the detailed plan of how we’re going to win a national championship?” And: “What do I need to do to turn myself into a first-round pick?”
Advertisement
The coaches looked around the room. They already had Daniels’ next few months mapped out, but for the quarterback to show this type of initiative? They knew what was coming. They knew he was about to take over.
“He put everything into that offseason,” says Joe Sloan, LSU’s QB coach at the time.
A nutritionist cooked Daniels’ meals and helped him pack on 15 pounds. He started nightly throwing sessions with his top two receivers, Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr., that would last until 10 p.m. In the mornings, Daniels and Wilson would race to the building for 5 a.m. film sessions. Eventually, the quarterback started showing up so early they had to change the keycodes on the door.
By the fall he was the best player in college football.
Then, one night in November, his season nearly slipped away. A nasty hit knocked Daniels out of the Tigers’ road loss to Alabama. “I’m shaking it off!” he shouted at Wilson in the medical tent. “I gotta finish this!” But the staff wouldn’t let him. One play, and one concussion, threatened to upend his pursuit of the Heisman Trophy.
He texted Wilson around 4 a.m. “They’ll probably give it to him,” Daniels wrote, referring to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr., Daniels’ chief competition for the award.
“Sounds like you’re quitting,” Wilson wrote back, tapping into Daniels’ competitive juices.
“I’m not quitting. Just stating the obvious.”
“If you’re gonna pack it in, fine.”
“F that,” Daniels wrote.
The two were in the film room at 5 a.m. on Monday. “This is the week that’ll define your career,” Wilson told him.
Daniels couldn’t drive, so Wilson picked him up. Daniels was still in concussion protocol, so Wilson used his own fingerprint to get them in the building. The QB watched film of Florida’s defense with sunglasses on, his hoodie pulled tight and the door shut. “Nobody knew we were there,” Wilson says. Daniels barely practiced that week but cleared protocol in time to start.
Turns out, the Heisman race wasn’t over. Daniels lit up the Gators for 606 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns in a 53-35 rout. A month later he stood on stage in New York City, trophy in hand.
On draft night four months later, Daniels waited one pick to hear his name called. He’d been No. 1 on Washington’s board all along, ahead of Caleb Williams, who went first to the Bears. “You put in all the work in the early mornings, the late nights,” Peters told him over the phone. “I couldn’t be more proud to pick you to represent our franchise.”
Advertisement
Then Peters handed the phone over to Dan Quinn. The coach was more direct: “We’re gonna kick a lot of ass together.”
Wilson texted a few days later, wanting Daniels’ thoughts on his new team.
“We’re going to the playoffs,” Daniels wrote back.
Wilson shook his head — the kid was nothing if not ambitious. But this wasn’t college football. The rookie needed to temper his expectations. “Brother, this is the NFL,” Wilson wrote. “This is different.”
Daniels wouldn’t budge.
“No, listen to me,” he replied. “We’re going to the playoffs.”
They meet at 9 a.m. every Saturday, an hour before the rest of the team has to be in the building. Inside the room, it’s just the quarterbacks and skill position players. The 23-year-old rookie stands at the front, running through the 10 or 12 scripted plays the offense plans to open the game with a day later. Daniels reminds them of the audibles he can check into and the coverage beaters he’ll be looking for.
“We’ve never had meetings like that here,” McLaurin says. “Not since I’ve been here.”
Kliff Kingsbury, Washington’s first-year offensive coordinator, designed his system around Daniels’ dual-threat ability — “The way he runs, it takes the soul of your defense,” Peters gushed on draft night — without putting too much on the rookie’s shoulders. A heavy dose of short, timing-based throws are mixed in with a stout run game and the occasional deep shot, a healthy balance the young passer can manage. Seven games in, the Commanders are third in scoring (30.1 points per game) and Daniels leads the league in completion percentage (75.6).
Marcus Mariota, Daniels’ backup, says the discipline of his decision-making is rare for a rookie, especially one drafted this high. There are certain expectations that greet a first-round quarterback the minute he walks through the door, expectations Mariota — the No. 2 pick in 2015 — knows well. Too many chase highlight plays, Mariota says, the ones they built their name on in college.

“So many times young guys in this league are trying to impress people,” he says. “They wanna extend plays and live up to their draft spot. Jayden’s very much, ‘I’ll take what you give me. And if you give me the big one, I’ll take that, too.'”
Sloan, now LSU’s offensive coordinator, has followed Daniels’ rookie season closely. Nothing’s surprised him. He can’t help but laugh when he thinks back to the question he kept getting from NFL evaluators last spring. They all wanted to know if Jayden Daniels was ready to be a pro.
“Listen,” Sloan kept telling them, “he’s already a pro.”

Jaxson Dart’s feathered blond hair was tucked under a black hoodie, zipped tightly to his chin. Stone-faced, the quarterback couldn’t stop shaking his head in disbelief.
“I don’t understand how we lost,” he said.
“We should win that game,” coach Lane Kiffin said.
Ole Miss had already suffered a loss to Kentucky. This one landed harder.

“We have followed a plan that was deliberate and intentional to make an effort to be in this first 12-team Playoff,” said Walker Jones, the executive director of The Grove Collective. “That started two years ago.”
It culminated this fall, Jones said, having invested more than $10 million into a roster loaded with talent and highly recruited transfers. Jones said that number likely ranks among the top half of SEC programs.
No. 18 Ole Miss’ goal is still technically in reach, but the 29-26 overtime loss to LSU on Oct. 12 sharply steepened the odds. Among the remaining opponents this season is No. 2 Georgia. The Rebels host Oklahoma this Saturday.
Name, image and likeness, with the NCAA forced by the courts to allow athletes to monetize it in 2021, quickly became the most important fuel for roster building in college sports’ endless arms race. Third-party collectives affiliated with schools became responsible for facilitating it, and Ole Miss was among the schools at the forefront of using the transfer portal to its advantage.

College football portal confidential: How tampering, NIL deals and portal chaos happen
Now, even as the way of doing business is changing again amid the House v. NCAA settlement, and with Ole Miss saddled with two losses, it would be easy to decry the roster as money wasted, to point to a program that fell short of its goals.
Jones has the same response to that sentiment he gave to countless donors during two years spent frantically fundraising.
“I don’t know if we’re going to get to the Playoff,” he said, days before the loss to LSU. “But I know how we’re not gonna get there. We’re not gonna get there if we don’t invest in a plan and commit to it.”
Jones was a former Ole Miss team captain and linebacker from 1994 to 1997 who later worked as the director of sports marketing for Under Armour and became an agent. He founded his own business before agreeing to lead Ole Miss’ NIL collective in the middle of 2022.
To educate the fan base and put a face on Ole Miss’ approach to NIL, he convinced athletic director Keith Carter to hold a news conference alongside him and Rebels coaches that fall. Despite alerting the SEC beforehand, that aggressive approach earned Carter a cautionary call from the conference afterward.

Ole Miss, Carter said, is intentional about being aggressive as a means of making up ground between it and competition with bigger budgets and that has had more success traditionally.
“The NIL world and compliance, it’s a lot about risk management now. How far do you think you should go? Can you go? We’ve walked that tightrope pretty well. We’ve been aggressive,” Carter said. “And we’ve done well with some of those calculated risks. And the playing field is leveled some with the new model.”
Jones built relationships with big-money donors and built a subscription platform for fans who could pledge only tens or hundreds of dollars a month.
On the field, Dart was showing promise as a sophomore first-year starter. The winds of change were blowing heavily toward an expanded Playoff, making Ole Miss’ dreams of inclusion more within reach. That December, the 12-team Playoff to launch in 2024 became official.
“We made a decision with coach Kiffin and others that said, ‘Hey, if we’re gonna get in that 12-team Playoff, we need to start now,” Jones said. “I stop short of saying all-in, Playoff-or-bust narrative. But it was an intentional and deliberate approach to put a team together this year to be one of those 12.”
Roster building means managing three worlds: high school recruiting, roster retention and, yes, the portal. The collective must work closely with the coaching staff.
Kiffin quickly agreed to stay mostly uninvolved with how much players were making, Jones said, and The Grove Collective leaves coaches out of financial decisions and negotiations with players. Like most of the more well-funded collectives, The Grove Collective has its own system of metrics and analytics it uses to find valuations for individual players, based on their positions and the team’s needs.
In 2023, Ole Miss signed 23 prospects to land the nation’s No. 2 transfer class, according to 247Sports, building on what Ole Miss had already started when it also landed the No. 2 class in 2022. Only four teams signed more transfers, and Louisiana Tech transfer Tre Harris highlighted the class. Harris leads the nation in receiving and had a highlight touchdown catch in the loss to LSU before being sidelined by an injury.

In 2024, the Rebels added 25 more transfers to sign the nation’s top portal class, with Kiffin embracing his status as the sport’s Portal King. Five-star defensive lineman Walter Nolen came from Texas A&M to highlight the class alongside Florida edge rusher transfer Princely Umanmielen, Alabama corner transfer Trey Amos and South Carolina receiver transfer Antwane Wells Jr.

In the first year, the collective, Jones said, spent far less on roster retention than in the next year. Key contributors wanted to be paid more for their efforts.
The speed-dating aspect of recruiting the portal meant enlisting team leaders like Dart, Harris and 325-pound, two-way player JJ Pegues to vet players and sign off on the dynamics of bringing transfer players into the program after they visited campus.
The market is settling, Jones said, but any good collective has to be nimble entering each new portal window as players, agents and collectives learn more about how to operate. And the portal works both ways.
Star running back Quinshon Judkins announced in January he was leaving Ole Miss for Ohio State after rushing for more than 2,700 yards and 31 touchdowns the previous two seasons. Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork told ESPN earlier this offseason the Buckeyes had $20 million to spend on their 2024 football roster.
Jones and The Grove Collective’s efforts in two short years have made waves. Kiffin said in a news conference earlier this year that former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze had attempted to pull Jones from his alma mater to help Auburn operate its collective. Jones said he got a chuckle out of it.
In September, Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek called out Arkansas fans at an event and said they needed to grow their numbers to be more like Ole Miss’ collective.

“Nobody loves that Ole Miss is in the top five, right? No. We hate it,” Yurachek told cameras and a crowd gathered at an event for program supporters.
The Grove Collective boasts 6,000 paid subscribers, Jones said, a large portion of whom had never given to Ole Miss before the NIL era and are under 35.
But the shocking home loss to Kentucky and the crushing defeat in Death Valley have caused the wheels underneath the fast start to wobble. What now?
“This isn’t a one-shot wonder. We’re going to continually build rosters that are relevant nationally and in the top 12 and trying to get into the Playoff every year,” Carter said. “If we don’t get in the Playoff this year, it isn’t over. We’re just getting started.”
What that looks like in the future is still unfolding. The House v. NCAA settlement, granted preliminary approval earlier this month, could bring new rules and guidelines to roster management as soon as the summer of 2025.
Some collectives might be brought in-house. Some might partner with schools. Some might stay independent but closely connected to the athletic departments they bolster. Each school will have to decide which model fits it best. The NCAA is looking to monitor “true market value” with a clearinghouse that would vet all NIL deals worth more than $600.
Revenue sharing, a major result of the settlement, with schools paying players directly, is expected to be set at a little more than $20 million next year and will rise as television deals grow more valuable.
“The limited information we have is there will be two buckets of money: the revenue sharing that’s mandated from the settlement and incremental, third-party, market-based NIL,” Jones said. “The second bucket, NIL, will be much harder to police and value, and there isn’t going to be a cap to it. One school might say, ‘We’re gonna spend another $30 million on top of that rev share.’ Another school might say, ‘Well, we only have $5 million we can spend.’”
Jones and The Grove Collective want to make sure Ole Miss is closer to the first group than the second.

Let me apologize in advance for cheating a bit.
We use the term “breakout” like it’s just spontaneous combustion, but that’s rarely how it happens. Like most reactions, usually they require a catalyst. Thus, the inherent issue about calling a “breakout” in advance is that often the term isn’t quite what we’re describing. Instead, the real breakout is one of opportunity, in the form of minutes and touches, rather than one of rapidly changing levels of play.
Advertisement
For example, check out last season’s Most Improved Player award winner, the Philadelphia 76ers’ Tyrese Maxey. Yes, he has made steady progress since his rookie year in 2020. But the big change for him last season wasn’t about his own game; it was about the departure of James Harden days into the season. That transaction opened the door for Maxey to become Philly’s primary on-ball initiator, increase his usage rate from 24.1 percent to 28.0 percent and up his scoring rate from 20.3 per game to 25.9.
You’ll find similar storylines littering the field when looking at my All-Breakout squad for this season, consisting of 11 players I think have a chance to significantly boost their production from a year ago.
The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process.
The story of the greatest plays in NBA history.
So, back to the cheating — I’ll also note that I cheated a second time since I already have 1/82 of the answers to the test. It’s a little easier to come up with an All-Breakout Team when you already have a peek at how minutes and touches will work for most of these teams after a few days of games.
That said, projecting breakouts can be a bit harder than it looks. Injuries, slumps and our misperceptions caused by our tiny human brains can easily send a potential breakout sideways. Take a gander at last season’s list, for instance.
I had the Most Improved Player (Maxey), but none of the other 13 players who received votes made my list. I had Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren and Scottie Barnes on my team, all of whom genuinely broke out … but I also had LaMelo Ball and Mikal Bridges. And then there’s Charlotte’s Mark Williams, who seemed like an easy call 12 months ago. He ended up playing 19 games.
With that said, let me bravely charge ahead into my list for this year. I tried to represent every level of the playing spectrum, so along with a few players who are already big stars, I have some deep cuts in secondary roles.
Advertisement
My 11-man All-Breakout Team for 2024-25:
Anthony Davis, C, Lakers
This isn’t just me riding the wave of Davis’ dominant opening night performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He’s low-key been on a heater for the last few months; Davis was one of the most productive players in preseason, even when most veterans throttle down to coasting speed, and was one of the best players on Team USA’s gold-medal winning squad.
Before that, he finished his 2023-24 regular season strong and was fantastic in the Lakers’ five-game, first-round defeat against the Denver Nuggets, averaging 27.8 points on 67 percent shooting and a playoff-leading 15.6 boards. He’s also, thankfully, playing full-time as a center, which is his most productive position even if he doesn’t like it.
Health and shooting will always be the swing variables for Davis, but he’s off to a good start on those fronts as well — he even made an above-the-break 3 in the opener. The bar is high for a “breakout” here, but with 39-year-old LeBron James’ volume possibly on the downslope and few others capable of soaking up the extra chances, this could be a career year for Davis.
GO DEEPER
Anthony Davis gives Lakers an early dose of hope — and a long-awaited blueprint
Dyson Daniels, SG, Atlanta
This one isn’t the usual case of a player breaking out because of an increase in touches and shots. This is a defensive breakout, where Daniels is being thrust into a role as the Hawks’ defensive stopper. He was a force at that end in New Orleans, but his role fluctuated because of a crowded backcourt and his iffy shooting, limiting him to 22 minutes per game across 61 appearances and just 17 total minutes in the playoffs.
That won’t be the case in Atlanta, where the Hawks have been desperate for an elite defender on the perimeter. The 6-foot-8, 21-year-old Daniels is starting and likely will see big minutes as along as his offense is at least somewhat threatening. If so, he has a great chance to lead the league in steals (he had five on opening night and was second in the NBA in steal rate a year ago) and a decent shot at cracking one of the All-Defensive teams.
Zion Williamson, PF/C, New Orleans
This one is a pure eye-test call: Williamson finished last season playing the best basketball of his career. He was in the midst of destroying the Lakers in a Play-In game when his hamstring betrayed him. All that seems to have carried over to this year, where he looks fantastic in preseason — statistically, sure, but even more so physically, exploding past people as he did as a rookie and accumulating heaps of layups.
Advertisement
All of this is juiced by his expected positional move to center. Even if it isn’t full-time, he should have enough reps at that spot that he can feast blowing past overmatched centers or compromising defenses as a rim-running screener if they try to match up smaller against him.
Williamson missed the Pelicans’ opener with an illness, but that should be a quick absence. I don’t know exactly how many games we’ll see of this version of him, but I’m excited about the possibility of seeing a full-ish season of peak Williamson. This feels like the season we might get it.
GO DEEPER
What's behind Zion Williamson's newfound drive? Trust
Amen Thompson, positionless, Houston
Between Wembymania and Thompson’s early-season injury, the hype machine for the fourth pick in the 2023 draft never really got rolling. I think that might change this year, when Thompson has a greater chance to establish himself as a hybrid center-guard-not-sure-what-to-call-it dynamo who can blow up offenses with his switchy, twitchy athleticism and wreak havoc in transition at the other end.
There are some barriers, as we saw on opening night. Thompson is coming off the bench, and his lack of shooting is exacerbated by a roster that already doesn’t have much reliable spacing. He still has to become a more refined decision-maker to take advantage of his ballhandling and athleticism too. That said, Thompson’s fine rookie season (18.2 PER, 57.6 percent true shooting, mammoth rebound and steal + block rates) largely went under the radar a season ago, and that doesn’t figure to be the case this season on a Houston squad that should be a League Pass favorite.
Josh Giddey, PG/SF, Chicago
Giddy only had a lukewarm opener against New Orleans’ feisty wing defenders, but I’ll stay on the bandwagon here. He should fit in his role in Chicago much more easily than he did in Oklahoma City as an on-ball creator with limited shooting gravity. That should provide him more opportunity to grow in some of the other areas (drawing fouls, defense, catch-and-shoots, etc.), where his limitations dragged him down with the Thunder. Additionally, Chicago’s situation should give Giddey a lot more opportunities to play through mistakes and develop on the floor.
Not that he’s chopped liver now. The 22-year-old is a plus passer and rebounder with an excellent floater game and good court vision, and for what it’s worth, he’s also one of the best inbound passers in basketball. That he’s also playing for a contract after he and the Bulls didn’t reach an extension this past week is another reason to believe in him taking a big step up.
GO DEEPER
Why teams held the line at the extension deadline, and which clubs made out best
Jalen Williams, SF, Oklahoma City
Just because it’s obvious doesn’t mean it isn’t true. The Thunder badly need a secondary shot creator to step up, especially with the aforementioned Giddey gone, and Williams is the clear candidate to soak up a lot of those touches and shots.
He’s also shown the capability of being a player who can handle that added responsibility efficiently, as he’s proven up to the challenge at each step of his development in his first two seasons with the Thunder. Again, it’s not just about the opportunity here, but about Williams having the talent to sustain a greater role on a winning team. For what it’s worth, Williams was awesome in his four preseason games, with a 30.1 PER on 66.3 percent true shooting.
Advertisement
RJ Barrett, SF, Toronto
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears, it, does it makes a sound? What if, instead of a forest, it’s Canada?
Barrett was already showing signs of turning a corner last season in New York, then played significantly better after the trade in Toronto. Nobody noticed because it happened in the general destitution of the Raptors’ 2023-24 season, but Barrett is becoming a dude.
In 32 games as a Raptor, Barrett averaged 21.4 points per game and shot 60.5 percent on 2s. The eye test backed it up; there was more comfort and control in the finishing, more nuanced shot selection and distribution and even (gasp) the occasional right-handed attack.
He built on that in the summer by arguably being Canada’s second-best Olympian, averaging 19.8 points on blistering 70.1 percent true shooting. While we didn’t see him in preseason due to a sprained AC joint, he’s listed as day-to-day and expected to rejoin the action soon, so it shouldn’t slow him down too much.
Entering his age-24 season, on a roster with basically four real players and some serious question marks, Barrett should have plenty of room to explore his limits and continue refining his hard-charging downhill game.
Tre Mann, SG, Charlotte
Mann is single-handedly trying to bring baggy back. Seeing him on the court in his 178-pound frame and size XXXXL jersey and shorts, it looks like one of those in-game promotions where they have kids put on an NBA player’s uniform then run around and try to score a basket.
Mann, however, is pretty good at the latter part. He scored 24 points in Charlotte’s upset of Houston on opening night, continuing a positive stretch of basketball dating to his trade from the Thunder last spring. Mann was one of the league’s most effective players statistically in preseason, which does have some predictive value, and quietly averaged double figures in 28 games for the Hornets at the end of last season.
Advertisement
This was a bit of a surprise, as he had struggled to gain traction for three years in Oklahoma City, and it’s possible his lack of size for a two guard and limited playmaking for a point guard restrict him going forward. As with Giddey above, there’s also a financial incentive. The Hornets could have extended Mann this past week (he’s on the last year of his rookie deal) and instead opted to wait and gather more information.
Julian Strawther, SF, Denver
I’m not even cheating on this one because the Nuggets hadn’t played yet when I wrote this. But Strawther seems to be at the right nexus of opportunity and production. He was eighth in the NBA in preseason scoring, and the Nuggets desperately need him to fill a void in the wing rotation created by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s departure. He also has the specific skill set they most crave, as a high-volume 3-point shooter on a team that was last in 3-point rate a year ago.
Strawther’s rookie season with the Nuggets was mostly spent watching, and his NBA minutes didn’t go all that well with an 8.2 PER and 29.7 percent 3-point shooting. However, the 22-year-old from Gonzaga has thrived in other settings — he’s had two strong summer leagues in addition to his 2024 preseason — and small-sample shooting variance explains much of his poor stats from 2023-24.
Cam Thomas’ green light, Brooklyn
I’m not sure whether this qualifies as a genuine breakout or just something that’s going to be fun as hell to watch. But if we’re talking about touches and opportunity? Sheesh. Thomas had 36 points on 27 shots opening night in Atlanta, and if you look at the Nets’ roster, that trend line seems likely to continue. There’s just nobody else on the team who can create shot volume like Thomas, and the volume will only increase if Brooklyn moves Dennis Schröder’s expiring contract.
Thomas has always been a high-volume player, ranking sixth in the league in field goal frequency a year ago. However, the criticism was about quality, not quantity. In the past, there have been too many tough 2-point jumpers and little in the way of playmaking, both of which dragged down his efficiency. Thomas corrected some of that in the opener, getting off 13 3-point attempts and making seven, and interjecting at least a couple of passing reads that let you talk yourself into growth there.
After 48 hours, he was third in the NBA in field goal attempts and second in scoring. With few other options on the Nets’ roster and operating in a contract year, Thomas may stay near the top of both columns all season.
Norman Powell, SG, LA Clippers
This isn’t quite on Thomas’ level, but Powell is in a contract year and looks set to re-establish at least some of his value on a Clippers team that really needs his scoring. Or maybe, as a “Cheers” fan, I just like to yell out “Norm!” occasionally.
Advertisement
Either way, Powell will be the second option next to James Harden for as long as Kawhi Leonard is out. When Leonard returns, Powell will likely revert to a sixth man role. A 17-point, four-assist opener in Phoenix is a good start for this trend line, and Powell did this while going 1 of 7 from 3 (he’s a 39.4 percent career shooter from distance).
Powell has the added benefit of no longer having to watch the Russell Westbrook show when he checks in with the Clippers’ subs. Instead, with Leonard injured and Paul George departed, it mostly will be his show any time Harden is off the floor. While Powell thrives best as a secondary scorer rather than a get-out-of-my-way guy, he’ll also have significant overlap with Harden where he can thrive off the ball. At age 31, he could end up threatening his career-high scoring average of 19.6 from back in Toronto.

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5870030/2024/10/25/ohtani-japan-dodgers-yankees-world-series/:

Shohei Ohtani has been a superstar in Japan for more than a decade, but one day earlier this year, a Tokyo resident named Tatsuo Shinke noticed something different.
Shinke, the CEO of Mint, a leading trading card store, had already watched as Ohtani’s soaring popularity had fueled the Japanese collectibles industry, spiked Japanese television ratings for Major League Baseball, and pushed baseball news into every corner and crevice of the country’s vast media ecosystem.
Advertisement
Yet as Ohtani made history in his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the first player in history to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in one season, Shinke observed another data point: His mother, Emiko.
At 73 years old, Emiko had never followed baseball. But because Ohtani’s Dodgers games are aired live in the morning in Japan, and because he has become a daily fixture on the country’s popular morning variety shows — the equivalent of “Good Morning America” or “Today” — Emiko developed a new morning routine: She wakes up, eats breakfast, and then turns on Ohtani.
“Elderly people in Japan love Ohtani,” Shinke said. “It’s my mother. And all my mother’s friends. She’s retired already, so she has enough time to watch all the games in the morning.”
In the United States, the World Series between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers is a matchup featuring the country’s two biggest cities and most high-profile franchises. The audience could surpass 20 million viewers per game for the first time since 2016.
In Japan, it will likely be even bigger.
In seven seasons in the majors, including six for the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani has lorded his talent over Major League Baseball in a manner previously thought impossible. For his trouble, he has captured two Most Valuable Player awards while dominating as a hitter and a pitcher. If he wins his third this November, as is expected, he will become the first full-time designated hitter to win the award, a role he was forced to play after injuring his elbow last season.
In America, his performance earned him a $700 million contract — the largest in history — and stardom in a sport that increasingly trails its rivals in cultural capital. But back home in Japan, where baseball is the most popular sport, Ohtani’s celebrity has reached stratospheric levels, akin to Michael Jordan or David Beckham, figures who transcended their field of play and whose fame turned them into international avatars for their home country.
Advertisement
“There isn’t a person in Japan who doesn’t know who Ohtani is, I don’t think,” said Robert Whiting, an American author in Tokyo who has written about Japanese baseball since the 1970s.
When the Dodgers defeated the Padres in Game 5 of the National League Division Series — a game that featured two Japanese starting pitchers — an estimated audience of 12.9 million Japanese viewers tuned in at 9 a.m. on a Saturday, at least 5.4 million more than watched in the U.S. When Ohtani chased 50-50 in September, his exploits often led the national nightly news and daytime “wide” shows, spaces that rarely mention sports. (The business newspaper Nikkei also ran a front-page story above the fold.) And when Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, spoke of Ohtani during a press conference in Tokyo earlier this season, he told reporters he wanted to speak not as an ambassador but “as a kid from Chicago” who watched Jordan rule the 1990s and transcend basketball.
“This is early on in Ohtani-san’s career,” Emanuel said, “but there’s no doubt that that’s what he has right now.”
The sheer volume of wall-to-wall coverage has even surprised Whiting, who first moved to Tokyo in the 1960s and has authored books on baseball and Japanese culture. Japan has seen this story before, the obsession over conquering baseball heroes in the form of Hideo Nomo, Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui, who was World Series MVP for the Yankees in 2009. But perhaps not since Nomo in the 1990s, Whiting says, has a Japanese player embodied and lifted the national spirit.
When Nomo debuted for the Dodgers in 1995 — in the middle of a nasty trade dispute between the United States and Japan — Whiting recalled that Asahi Shimbun, one of the nation’s biggest newspapers, ran an editorial stating: “In Hideo Nomo, the Japanese have produced a product that no one is complaining about.” But whereas Nomo, Suzuki and later pitchers like Yu Darvish validated the quality of Japanese baseball, Ohtani has changed the equation: For the first time, Japanese fans can credibly argue that the most talented baseball player of all time is from Japan.

“In the global market, Japanese value and power is (becoming) a little bit weaker, year by year,” said Tomoki Negishi, a baseball marketing executive who worked for Japan’s Pacific League. “So Ohtani-san’s great performance is a beacon.”
To some, he says, Ohtani is “a symbol of Japan in the global market.”
To others?
“He is just a crazy superhero that I’ve never seen before,” Negishi says.
On the morning of October 12, the symbol beamed through a television into a living room in Ōta, a special ward in Tokyo. Masanori Ninomiya, an owner of an English reading company, finished a traditional breakfast of white rice, miso soup and fruit and then turned on the Dodgers and Padres.
Ninomiya, 59, grew up in the city of Oita, obsessing over books about Japanese baseball history. He attended business school at UCLA in the ’90s, as Nomo was breaking through. He is among those in Tokyo who work remotely, which allows him to put the Dodgers on in the background during the work week.
“Everybody will have a breakfast,” he said “And then it’s Ohtani.”
In Japan, all Dodgers games appear on NHK, the country’s free, over-the-air public broadcaster. The audience for NHK often skews older, especially in the mornings. Unlike the United States, where European soccer fans huddle in bars and pubs in the morning, there is less public consumption of Ohtani, outside of major events like the World Baseball Classic. According to Negishi, this is partly due to cultural norms and partly because of the sheer volume of baseball games.
“I’m sure I’m not the only one,” said Chen Liang, director of imports at Mint cards and collectibles. “But there’s a huge percentage of Japanese people who are at work, and they’re in front of their computer, and they’re just clicking on the box score while they look at Excel sheets and things like that.”
Advertisement
Ninomiya was awed by Ohtani when he emerged as a two-way player for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He followed him when he debuted with the Angels in 2018, when the morning ritual began. But he ascribes the national love affair to the way Ohtani has conducted himself on the MLB stage.
“For example, if there’s garbage on the ground, he tries to pick it up,” Ninomiya said. “We know he’s a superstar — and super rich — but he doesn’t behave like that.”
Ohtani and his representatives have cultivated an image in Japan of a modest, polite baseball star who is deferential to teammates and respectful to elders. The reputation helped Ohtani weather a wave of public scrutiny earlier this year, when his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was charged with stealing more than $16 million from an Ohtani bank account to cover gambling debts. (Mizuhara later pleaded guilty.) It’s also helped him land a raft of endorsements from companies on both sides of the Pacific and turn his personal life into daily fodder on television. (His wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and his dog, translated to Dekopin in Japanese, are regular characters on the daytime shows.)
“Those are traits that I think Japanese fans love to see in practice on a foreign land,” said Hiroshi Kitamura, an associate professor of history at William & Mary who specializes in U.S.-East Asian relations. “Japanese fans love to see MLB players like (Aaron) Judge, (Fernando) Tatis, (Ronald) Acuna say great things about Ohtani as being the unicorn. But I think they also appreciate seeing Ohtani kind of being Japanese. In that sense, I think Japanese fans see Ohtani as part of them.”
The face of Major League Baseball greeted Foster Griffin each day when he arrived in Tokyo. The billboards. The cardboard likenesses in convenience stores. Ohtani’s voice even features in advertisements on the subway.
Soon after Griffin, a former Kansas City Royals pitcher, moved to Japan to pitch for the Yomiuri Giants, he learned the cultural primacy of televised nightly news.
“And he has his own section of the news,” Griffin said. “They highlight everything he does every day over there. He’s everywhere.”

From an American perspective, it’s hard to conceive of the popularity of Ohtani in Japan. America does not revere any foreign sports in which they are not supreme. The Japanese media, a sprawling apparatus with five commercial television networks and five national daily newspapers, can be impenetrable for non-Japanese speakers. And contrary to hyperbole, not everyone in Japan cares about baseball.
“Culturally, I felt like in recent years, the interest of young kids seemed headed to new sports like soccer,” said Ema Ryan Yamazaki, a Japanese filmmaker raised in Osaka.
The sport, however, remains a cultural unifier, a source of connection at the office or during the morning commute. And Ohtani has transcended demographics, spawning new generations of fans while appealing to retired grandmothers in Tokyo, Fukuoka and Sapporo.
“The school teacher understands a balk and an intentional walk, throughout the entire country,” said Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager who had two stints in Japan as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. “It’s like a port of passage. Baseball allows you to be acceptable in the culture. It’s just one of those things.”
When Ohtani led the country to a World Baseball Classic championship last year, more than 42 percent of Japanese households watched Japan defeat the United States at 8 a.m on a Wednesday. Six of Japan’s seven WBC games drew more than 30 million viewers. Ohtani’s presence — along with starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto — could help the Japanese World Series audience approach those heights. The numbers are already so striking that MLB continues to target the Japanese market, and will open the 2025 season with the Dodgers facing the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo, a year after the Dodgers opened the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres. Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic this week that “If you’re going to open (the season) in Tokyo, the only choice was to take the Dodgers again. And the reason it’s the only choice is the audiences that those games deliver are so big that it drives what’s a real broadcast business for us in Japan.”
The first pitch of the World Series will come at 9:08 a.m. on Saturday, airing on both NHK and commercial network Fuji TV. Interest is so high that creators of the wildly popular manga show “One Piece” pushed back a season premiere, to not compete with Ohtani.
“Smart move to move the show on their part,” Yamazaki said. “I would, too.”
Advertisement
As Ninomaya puts it, the only figure in Japan who could conceivably surpass Ohtani in name recognition is the prime minister, and the current one, Shigeru Ishiba, just took office earlier this month.
“Some young people may not know our prime minister,” he said. “But even kids — junior high school students, senior high school students — everybody knows Ohtani.”
Yes, every generation in Japan is ready for breakfast with Ohtani. Even if there is one that appears most charmed.
Earlier this year, Whiting, 82, was talking to his wife, Machiko Kondo, who worked for years as a resettlement officer at the United Nations. For decades, Kondo never expressed any interest in baseball, even as Whiting wrote best-selling books about Japanese baseball history and the meaning of Ichiro, even as he followed games on both sides of the Pacific.
But then came Ohtani.
“I’ve written all these baseball books that have gotten national attention, and it doesn’t mean anything to her,” Whiting said. “But now with Ohtani, she’s started asking: ‘Did Ohtani have any home runs?’”

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5870864/2024/10/24/amir-abdur-rahim-death-usf-coach/:

South Florida men’s basketball coach Amir Abdur-Rahim died Thursday while undergoing a medical procedure, the school confirmed. Abdur-Rahim was 43.
The school said in a statement that complications arose during his treatment at a Tampa-area hospital.
“All of us with South Florida Athletics are grieving with the loved ones of Coach Abdur-Rahim,” athletic director Michael Kelly said in a statement. “He was authentic, driven, and his infectious personality captivated all of Bulls Nation. Coach Abdur-Rahim leaves a lasting impact on our student-athletes, the University, and the community.”
Advertisement
Abdur-Rahim was seen as a rising star in the profession and a potential major program coach. He led a remarkable turnaround in his first season with the Bulls last year, earning unanimous American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors. He coached South Florida to a school-record 25 victories, its first regular-season conference title ever, its first appearance in the polls and its first NIT appearance in more than a decade.
Before taking over the Bulls in March 2023, Abdur-Rahim, a Georgia native, guided Kennesaw State to 26 wins and its first trip to the NCAA Tournament after the program went 1-28 in his first season at the helm (2019-20).
The Southeastern Louisiana graduate also spent time as an assistant at Georgia and Texas A&M.
“In a very short time, Coach Abdur-Rahim made an indelible impact on the University of South Florida,” school president Rhea Law said. “Throughout my time working with Coach Abdur-Rahim, I was continually inspired by his leadership, and truly admired his sincere approach to connecting with our entire student body. His influence on our student-athletes, coaching staff and the university community will live on forever.”
Corey Staniscia witnessed Abdur-Rahim’s influence and sincere connections firsthand as the director of the Bulls’ Fowler Ave Collective. Abdur-Rahim sent random supportive text messages. More than once, he hung around the campus Starbucks and put students’ drinks on his tab.
The last time Staniscia saw him, he asked how the team was jelling. Abdur-Rahim’s answer: “I’m getting them to love each other.”
“That man loved his athletes and what he did,” Staniscia said. “He truly did care about them.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better person to be here.”
Abdur-Rahim is survived by his wife, Arianne Buchanan, and three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin. His older brother, Shareef, was a longtime forward in the NBA.
Abdur-Rahim’s death comes less than a week before South Florida’s scheduled exhibition against Edward Waters. The school did not announce an interim coach.

NEW YORK — The Los Angeles Dodgers will finally get their parade. Four years after winning a championship during a pandemic, they are back atop the baseball world and ready to celebrate.
Trailing by five runs early in Game 5 of the World Series on Wednesday, the Dodgers capitalized on a series of errors and misplays by the New York Yankees, storming to a 7-6 victory at Yankee Stadium. It is their eighth championship in franchise history and first since 2020, when they could not hold a parade because of pandemic restrictions.
Freddie Freeman, who tied a World Series record with 12 runs batted in, drove in the tying runs in a five-run rally in the fifth, after errors by Aaron Judge and Anthony Volpe and a critical blunder by Gerrit Cole, who failed to cover the bag on a grounder to first that should have ended the inning.

Mookie Betts, who hit that grounder, later brought in the winning run with a sacrifice fly in the eighth inning. Walker Buehler, who started and won Game 3, finished off the Yankees with his first career save, fanning Alex Verdugo for the final out.
The Dodgers’ relentlessness pays off
The biggest threat in the Dodgers lineup is not the hitters’ ability to knock the ball out of the ballpark. It is their ability to wear down opposing pitching staffs and create cracks to slip through. The Dodgers got their looks against the Yankees in this series, even if there were times when they struggled to capitalize. It took the Yankees fumbling on defense in the fifth inning just to allow the Dodgers back into Game 5.
The tax came due on New York’s bullpen on Wednesday. Clay Holmes, pitching for the fifth time in five games this series, managed a scoreless seventh inning. When the door swung again for Tommy Kahnle and Luke Weaver in the eighth inning, the Yankees could no longer cling to their advantage.
A leadoff single for Kiké Hernández. An infield single for Tommy Edman. A walk for Will Smith. Then the Yankees’ inability to generate swing-and-miss allowed the Dodgers to cash in. Gavin Lux worked a full count before lofting a game-tying sacrifice fly to center. After a catcher’s interference sent Shohei Ohtani to first base to load the bases again, Betts jumped on the first pitch he saw from Weaver for a sacrifice fly that put the Dodgers ahead for good, 7-6. They simply would not go away.
Yankees embarrass themselves in fifth inning
There have been several instances throughout the season when the Yankees have lost all semblance of basic fundamentals, whether due to base-running mistakes, defensive errors or mental lapses.
The lack of fundamentals showed up at the worst time for the Yankees. Cole was cruising until the fifth inning when the defense collapsed. Judge dropped a line drive hit directly at him; he closed his glove too early, and the ball dropped to the ground. Will Smith, the next Dodgers batter, hit a groundball into the hole to Volpe, who ranged to his right. Volpe tried to get the force out at third base but threw the ball in the dirt to Jazz Chisholm Jr., who could not scoop it. With the bases loaded, Betts then hit a soft ground ball to Anthony Rizzo, who did not charge the ball hard enough, and Cole forgot to cover first base.

According to STATS, this was the second time in postseason history that a team blew a five-plus run lead with all of the runs being unearned. The previous time came in the 1956 World Series when the Yankees blew a five-run lead against the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 2.
Cole’s need for six outs to escape the fifth inning led to the Dodgers scoring five runs, tying the score at 5-5. It was an embarrassing and inexcusable display of baseball from the Yankees.
The downside of the Dodgers’ bullpen game in Game 4
The Dodgers’ handling of Game 4 was not illogical in a vacuum. They had a 3-0 lead series lead. Their top relievers had been used heavily in those games. Despite Game 4 being winnable — the Dodgers trailed by a run in the sixth, and two entering the bottom of the eighth — manager Dave Roberts said he had no qualms about how he handled the situation. Whoever he would have used would not be an option for a Game 5 and Jack Flaherty has already struggled on regular rest this October.
The clear downside played out on Wednesday. Flaherty had no semblance of command and got booted out before the Dodgers would have even had a chance to pivot to their top relief arms. A Yankees lineup that had not slugged all series broke open in the eighth inning of Game 4 and carried that into the early stages of Game 5.
Early assault
The Yankees jumped out to what looked like a commanding 5-0 lead largely because Cole cruised early. And because his offense flexed some muscle in a way it hasn’t all playoffs.
First-inning homers from Judge (two-run) and Chisholm, an RBI single from Verdugo and Giancarlo Santon’s solo shot in the third provided Cole a sweet cushion.
Judge broke open the scoring with a bomb to right-center field, bringing in Juan Soto, who had walked with one out. Yankee Stadium went wild as he rounded the bases, perhaps flushing what had been a weak postseason performance to this point in a career filled with them. Judge crushed a middle-middle first-pitch fastball —the type of pitch he had been missing for weeks. Chisholm’s seemed like icing on the cake. He smoked a home run well over the wall in right field, posing the millisecond it left his bat.

In the second inning, Volpe continued his hot hitting, ripping a double down the left-field line before moving to third on a groundout and scoring when Verdugo lined a single to right. The Yankees actually loaded the bases with two outs for Chisholm, but he couldn’t beat out a weak tapper to first base.
Stanton led off the third inning by homering off the first pitch from reliever Anthony Banda — a fastball chest high and out over the plate, which allowed the DH to extend his mighty arms and hit one well over the wall in right.

NEW YORK — Walker Buehler spread his arms wide and waited for his teammates to engulf him, the most fitting symbol of a season defined by persistent resilience. Called into emergency relief, Buehler closed out the World Series and shut the door on the New York Yankees as the Los Angeles Dodgers captured a 7-6 victory in a heart-stopping Game 5.
Advertisement
The game did not go as the Dodgers designed it. Then again, little did for them in 2024. Yet they will finish the season as champions of the world. They can thank Buehler, pitching on only one day of rest after starting Game 3, less than two years removed from a second Tommy John surgery. His scoreless frame stunned the crowd at Yankee Stadium and incited a mid-field jubilee from the Dodgers.
Freddie Freeman was an easy choice for World Series MVP after homering in the first four games and providing a crucial, two-run single as the Dodgers erased a five-run deficit in the fifth inning. Yankees ace Gerrit Cole capsized as his defense crumbled around him and made three fielding glitches. All five runs were unearned.
The comeback only set the stage for the excruciating conclusion. Called into duty in the sixth inning, Blake Treinen recorded seven outs. An eighth-inning rally capped by sacrifice flies by second baseman Gavin Lux and outfielder Mookie Betts put the Dodgers in front. Buehler kept them there, ensuring that a parade will roll down Figueroa Street later this week.
“I’m sure there’s no asterisk on this one,” manager David Roberts said.
This title, the eighth in franchise history, can stand beside the Dodgers’ trophy from the pandemic-shortened season in 2020. The championship validated a $1.4 billion offseason splurge built around Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, solidified the historical standing of Roberts and brought president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman closer to a vision he outlined earlier this month.
“My ultimate, big-picture goal is that, when we are done, that we’re able to look back and say, ‘That was the golden era of Dodger baseball,’” Friedman said. “And that is an incredibly high bar to even say that.”
TEOSCAR HERNÁNDEZ TIES IT FOR THE @DODGERS! #WORLDSERIES pic.twitter.com/RZToAqDBHs
— MLB (@MLB) October 31, 2024
The standard was set in the last century. The Dodgers won four titles between 1955 and 1965 as the franchise transitioned from the Boys of Summer in Brooklyn to the kings of Southern California. Those were the days of Jackie Robinson and Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Duke Snider, Roy Campanella and Pee Wee Reese. The precedent feels preposterous until you consider the current Dodgers who will one day join them in the Hall of Fame. That Cooperstown group could expand to include Roberts and Friedman.
Advertisement
The current era started in the spring of 2012 when Mark Walter formed a group to purchase the Dodgers from bankrupt parking lot magnate Frank McCourt. Walter’s Guggenheim Baseball Management paid $2.15 billion. Walter tasked Stan Kasten, a veteran executive from the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals, to be team president. After winning the National League West in 2013 and 2014 but falling short in October, Kasten approached Friedman, an innovative thinker who had established the small-market Tampa Bay Rays as a force among the big spenders in the American League East.
“He was in a great organization, a great organization,” Kasten said. “But this is the Dodgers.”
Under Friedman, the Dodgers established hegemony in the West. The team lost the 2017 World Series to the Houston Astros, who were later revealed to be using an illegal sign-stealing scheme, and then lost to the Boston Red Sox in the Series again in 2018. The group did not break through until 2020, in a season limited to 60 games by the COVID-19 pandemic and a World Series contained within a so-called bubble in Arlington, Texas.
The celebration after beating the Tampa Bay Rays morphed into a COVID-19 scare when clubhouse leader Justin Turner learned late in the game he had tested positive for the virus. There was no champagne bash at the ballpark and no rally awaiting them in Los Angeles. One of the items Roberts donated to the Hall of Fame was his mask. The players scattered across the country on private flights or long car rides. “It was like we were Navy SEALs,” former Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson said in the spring of 2023. “Did a mission, completed it and you just don’t hear about it.” At the team’s Arizona spring training home, there is no signage commemorating the title.
In the years after the championship, the Dodgers behaved as a bumbling colossus, beset by public relations gaffes and early October exits. The goodwill from the title was squandered on Trevor Bauer. The team won 106 games in 2021 but foundered in the National League Championship Series. A 111-win team in 2022 got rocked in four postseason games. The 100-win 2023 Dodgers were swept in the National League Division Series.

The defeats soured the public perception of the team and embittered the group. Players and team officials groused about perceived villains both internal and external: Max Scherzer and Jake Cronenworth, Lance Lynn and Eddie Rosario, the red herring of the layoff wrought by the expanded postseason. “We’ve got to find a way to get back up and not feel sorry for ourselves and get better,” Roberts said after losing to the 84-win Arizona Diamondbacks last year. “That’s just the only option.”
A week after Roberts spoke, Friedman polled a few players to preview the offseason. He had two new stars in mind: Ohtani and Yamamoto. When Freeman asked if Walter would shoulder the cost, Friedman was insistent. “Mark,” he told Freeman, “wants to win really bad.” That desire became clear to Ohtani when he met with the Dodgers. Walter informed Ohtani he considered his tenure as an owner to be a failure. One title, after all those Octobers, was not enough. The moment lingered with Ohtani, who mentioned it at the press conference after he signed his historic, heavily deferred, 10-year, $700 million contract.
The total outlay for the winter surpassed 10 figures. Ohtani was the biggest ticket. The others were not cheap: $325 million, plus a $50 million posting fee for Yamamoto; a $111.5 million extension after a trade for pitcher Tyler Glasnow; a $23.5 million flier on outfielder Teoscar Hernández. The path to October looked clear. At spring training, a rival general manager cracked to The Athletic: “So how many games are the Dodgers going to win this year, 120?”
The number was 98, a hard 98, the sort of 98 that added more gray to Friedman’s stubble. So much went wrong it can be hard to recall what went right. The season opened with a worldwide scandal after Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, admitted to swindling his friend out of millions to finance gambling debts. Betts and Yamamoto suffered serious injuries in June. A rash of pitching ailments has prompted an internal reckoning with their development process. In September, with the team trying to fend off the Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres, Glasnow was ruled out for October because of a recurrent elbow injury. “Everyone was like, ‘Man, not again,’” third baseman Max Muncy said earlier this month.
WALKER BUEHLER CLOSES IT OUT! #CHAMPS pic.twitter.com/1S2242udt6
— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) October 31, 2024
The team received the Glasnow news while in Atlanta. Roberts called a meeting. He reminded them what the name on the front of their jersey represented. “We’re still the Dodgers,” he told them. And he reminded them what the names on the backs meant, too.
“You have a meeting,” Muncy said, “and say, ‘Guys, look around. We still have Hall of Famers in this room. We still have All-Stars in this room. We have guys who are getting paid a lot of money in this room. We can still do this.’”
The first step was the toughest. The San Diego Padres pushed the Dodgers to the brink in the NLDS. Down 2-1, bereft of starting pitching, Roberts asked his relievers for 27 outs to keep the season alive in Game 4. The players gathered before the game and discussed ridding themselves from the burden of expectations. The group responded with a shutout. Two days later, Yamamoto bested his countryman Yu Darvish in a decisive Game 5 victory. The Padres did not score a run during the final 24 innings of the series, a stunning result given the talent on San Diego’s roster.

The rest of the competition paled to the Padres. The Dodgers smashed both of New York’s baseball clubs these past two weeks. The National League Championship Series was a six-game demolition. After Freeman launched his grand, Gibsonian walkoff in Game 1 against the Yankees, the Dodgers got the job done.
The final game tested their resilience. Jack Flaherty permitted four runs before exiting with one out in the second. When the fifth inning began, the Dodgers trailed by five and Cole had not given up a hit. A series of Yankees miscues opened the door. Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball. Anthony Volpe spiked a throw in the dirt. Cole neglected to cover first on a slow roller down the line. With two outs and the bases loaded, Freeman slashed a two-run single. Hernández followed with a two-run double to tie the game.
The Yankees did not cower. They declined to chase wayward offerings from relievers like Alex Vesia and Brusdar Graterol. The erratic command of the Dodgers bullpen put men on base and fouled up Roberts’ pitching plan. Graterol walked Juan Soto and Judge to start the sixth. After Soto took third on a grounder, Giancarlo Stanton lofted a ball deep enough to bring the go-ahead run home.
From there, Roberts was forced to solve an equation with insufficient data. He had lined up six relievers behind Flaherty. But the abbreviated outing from Flaherty and the waywardness from the other pitchers forced his hand. Blake Treinen was the sixth reliever in Roberts’ trust tree. He was supposed to close the game. But he entered the game after Graterol failed to hold the line in the sixth.
As Treinen toiled on the mound, an assortment of pitchers loosened up in the bullpen. Buehler had been there since the fifth inning. Daniel Hudson also got up to throw. The lineup soon gave them a lead to protect. The group loaded the bases with no outs in the eighth. Sacrifice flies from Lux and Betts put the Dodgers ahead.
Treinen returned for the eighth as the heart of the Yankees’ order loomed. Judge awakened the crowd with a one-out double. The ballpark entered a froth when Treinen walked third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. Roberts left his dugout. He gestured to Treinen to settle down. The closer’s night was not done. Treinen steeled himself to get Stanton to pop up before striking out first baseman Anthony Rizzo to strand the runners.
The bullpen door opened for Buehler at 11:43 p.m. Earlier, he told Roberts: “If it gets squirrelly, I’m ready,” and went to the bullpen on his own accord. He made the emergency assignment look easy. Volpe grounded out. Wells struck out. The final pitch of the 2024 season was a knuckle curveball. Yankees outfielder Alex Verdugo could only touch the air. The rest of the Dodgers mobbed Buehler. The celebration had only begun for this franchise.
They will get their title without an asterisk. The people of Los Angeles will get their parade. And the patina of this era will look that much closer to golden.

NEW YORK — Freddie Freeman’s father, Fred, thinks it really started to happen sometime last season, his son’s second with the Dodgers. After a dozen years playing for the Atlanta Braves, Freddie and his family were finally growing comfortable in Los Angeles, embracing a new identity.
Not long after midnight on Thursday, the elder Freeman had no doubt: one of the greatest World Series performances ever left his son a Dodger.
Advertisement
“That’s the nicest thing you ever can say: He feels like a Dodger, he looks like a Dodger, and then, he’s a Dodger,” Fred Freeman said on the field at Yankee Stadium as the celebration began.
Freddie was also named the series’ Most Valuable Player. The final game Wednesday night, a topsy-turvy 7-6 Dodgers win over the New York Yankees, was anomalous because Game 5 was the only game of the series in which he did not hit a home run.

Freddie Freeman is your #WorldSeries MVP! pic.twitter.com/7APcdvH544
— MLB (@MLB) October 31, 2024
The 35-year-old Freeman is the only player ever to go deep in each of the first four games of the World Series, and he batted .300 in the series (6-for-20), with a .364 on-base percentage and a 1.000 slugging percentage.
Freeman also drove in 12 runs in the series, matching Bobby Richardson’s 1960 record for the most in a World Series, and putting him in a three-way tie for third-most all-time in any postseason series. Only Adolis García (15 in the 2023 ALCS) and Nelson Cruz (13 in the 2011 ALCS) have had more.
But in the middle of the celebration, Freeman wasn’t ready to contextualize his feats.
“It’s hard to comprehend because we just won about an hour ago. I haven’t really thought about all that,” Freeman said. “To come through in those situations, that’s what you dream about as a kid, doing that in the World Series. It’s hard to talk about right now, but maybe in a few days when I’ve let it settle in, I’ll have better answers for you. Right now I’m just ecstatic.”
It’s a Fall Classic performance that rises to the level of baseball lore, not just Dodgers lore, and the most memorable moment was the first. Freeman’s walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning of Game 1 put the Yankees in a hole they never did recover from.
“We felt pretty good coming in, but when you have something special like that happen, wow, that just kind of kick-started it,” teammate Max Muncy said. “I thought it was pretty fitting for Freddie to do what he did in this World Series.
Advertisement
“The whole postseason, we kept going to Freddie and saying, ’Hey, we got you. We know you’re grinding for us right now, but we got you.’ And this World Series, Freddie told us, ‘Hey, I got you guys. You covered me, now I got you.’ And that’s exactly what happened.’”
A right ankle sprain suffered in late September reasonably could or should have kept him from playing anywhere close to this level. For a time, Freeman’s father had to chauffeur him to Dodger Stadium for physical therapy because Freeman couldn’t drive himself with a boot on.
“I was driving him in and staying for six hours and watching him get pushed on and prodded. And for a week doing that, it was beyond what any two weeks should do,” Fred Freeman said. “He’s tougher than I am, that’s for sure. ‘Cause I don’t know any other person who could have done that. Maybe Shohei (Ohtani).”
But the mental burden Freeman carried this season outweighed any physical ailment. Freeman’s youngest son, Maximus, was in an intensive care unit after being treated for Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. The three-year-old came home in early August after an eight-day stay.
“I wish I’d never had to go through what we did as a family,” Freeman said. “But ultimately Maximus is doing really, really well right now. He’s a special boy, but it has been a grind for three months. It really has. It’s been a lot.
“Then obviously with the injuries at the end, it makes it all worth it kind of in the end. I’ll never compare Maximus to baseball. I won’t. It’s just two separate things, but with him doing really well now, it does mean a little bit extra.”
That Freeman wound up in Los Angeles at all was a surprise. The six-year, $162 million deal he signed heading into the 2022 season didn’t appear likely even to Dodgers brass. Freeman was happy in Atlanta, but that team traded for a replacement at first base, Matt Olson, and the Dodgers capitalized. On his first trip back to Atlanta with his new team, Freeman cried during a press conference.
Advertisement
“We had significant interest, but we thought the odds of it happening were incredibly low,” Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said amid the celebration. “So we kind of put it off to the side, worked through other scenarios, and it wasn’t until the Olson trade we were like, wow OK, this has a real chance. So that’s where it became more real.”
“First of all, I think we are opportunistic,” said Dodgers president Stan Kasten. “When that offseason started, we didn’t know we’d have Freddie. When the opportunity presented itself, we jumped at it. That’s how we are.”
It will go down as one of the franchise’s greatest acquisitions. But Friedman didn’t bring Freeman to the Dodgers without a strong sense of pragmatism, of objectivity.
Baseball has long held debates about whether some players have the ability to elevate their game in big moments, and especially in October; is it something special in their build? Or are postseason performances most rationally discussed as someone getting hot at the right time?
“I don’t know the answer to that question,” Friedman said, “but I know I want Freddie Freeman in the box.”

Every school plays 14 teams once and three teams twice.

A Conservative Case Against Trump
In a choice between misfortunes, one is clearly worse.
By Bret Stephens
Since joining The Times in 2017, I have written about everything from China’s long-term decline to the enduring relevance of Edmund Burke to my grandmother’s advice about sex to my misgivings about The Times’s 1619 Project. I’m often described as a conservative, though I’ve been a harsh critic of the direction of the Republican Party. I believe in free enterprise, free trade, free speech, and the need to safeguard the institutions of democracy at home and abroad. I also think it’s healthy to be able to change your mind and to say so publicly — as I have about Trump voters and climate change.
My hometown is Mexico City. I studied political philosophy at the University of Chicago and comparative politics at the London School of Economics. I worked for The Wall Street Journal in Brussels, where I mainly covered European topics, and was editor in chief of The Jerusalem Post, where I covered Middle Eastern ones. For many years I was The Journal’s foreign-affairs columnist, for which I won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for commentary. I’m the author of “America in Retreat: The New Isolationism and the Coming Global Disorder.” In 2022, the government of Russia barred me for life.
Every word I publish in The Times is rigorously fact-checked and edited. I am a national judge of the Livingston Awards but recuse myself whenever work is submitted by colleagues or personal acquaintances. The Times alone pays for my reporting trips. I don’t blurb books unless they are excerpts from columns or commissioned reviews. I sit on a few academic and nonprofit advisory boards, from which I derive no income or other benefit. Work I perform outside The Times is approved by The Times. I’m not on Twitter — sorry, “X” — or any other form of social media. Learn more about The Times’s standards.

Donald and Melania Trump Were Made for Each Other
The former first lady’s new book shows that she still doesn’t care.
By Carlos Lozada
I write about politics, culture, history and policy, mainly through the prism of nonfiction books or other texts, like Supreme Court opinions, congressional investigations or commission reports. I’m especially intrigued by how public figures reveal themselves, intentionally or unwittingly, through their writings. When I write about campaign books, political biographies or Washington memoirs, people often say to me, “You read those books so we don’t have to!” True, you don’t have to — but trust me that there is much to learn in them. This work has led to two books of my own: “What Were We Thinking: A Brief Intellectual History of the Trump Era” (2020) and “The Washington Book: How to Read Politics and Politicians” (2024). I try to avoid armchair opinion mongering. Instead, I seek to give a fair hearing to a variety of ideas and arguments and then help readers draw their own conclusions, as I draw mine.
Before joining The Times in 2022, I spent 17 years at the Washington Post, where I was the nonfiction book critic, Outlook editor, national security editor and economics editor. Previously, I was the managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine. Early in my career, I was a consultant at the Inter American Development Bank and an analyst in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. I studied economics and political science at the University of Notre Dame and did graduate studies in public policy at Princeton University and in journalism at Columbia University. I was born in Lima, Peru, and became a U.S. citizen in 2014. I received the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2019 and currently serve on the Pulitzer Board.
I strive for fairness, honesty and depth. I believe that there is something called truth, and I do my best to approximate it. My overriding value is skepticism. Along with all Times journalists, I am committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.

Why Trump’s Closing Argument Is Full of ‘Locker Room Talk’
By all appearances, he’s embracing vulgarity to exploit the voter gender gap.
By Charles M. Blow
I am fascinated by precedents and historical corollaries — I view human beings as stuck in rotation of our failings and frailties — so I often use history to contextualize our present-day politics. I’ve written, for example, about the enduring legacy of lynching and what the presidential election of 1912 can teach us about fighting extremism. I also reflect on lessons from my own life as a queer man who grew up poor in rural Louisiana.
I have written two New York Times best-selling books: “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” which has been turned into an opera, and “The Devil You Know,” which inspired the HBO documentary “South to Black Power.” I joined The New York Times in 1994 as a graphics editor, later becoming the paper’s graphics director and eventually the Times’s design director for news. I left in 2006 for National Geographic, where I was the magazine’s art director, before returning to The New York Times in 2008 as an Opinion columnist. I received a B.A. in mass communications from Grambling State University in Louisiana. I am a political analyst for MSNBC, and I live in Atlanta.
I strive to be accurate, fair and empathetic in my writing. Every piece I publish is fact-checked and edited. Along with all Times journalists, I am committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.

The Election Is Happening Too Soon
When we all think we’re right, we stay perennially stuck in place.
By David Brooks
I write about political, social and cultural trends, the clash of ideas and the always tricky subject of moral formation.
I’ve been writing on a daily basis pretty much since the wee age of 7. I’ve worked at a variety of magazines and newspapers ranging from National Review, Newsweek and The Weekly Standard, and The Wall Street Journal and The Times.
I am the author of several books, including “Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There,” “The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement,” a New York Times best seller, and most recently, “How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen.”
I graduated from The University of Chicago with a degree in history. I have taught at Yale, Duke and The University of Chicago, and I am a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Emotionally, my home is New York City, below 23rd Street, though physically I’ve lived in Washington, D.C., for decades.
I’ve tried to present a reasonable voice in the midst of all the bitterness and strife of public life. I’ve tried to live out a philosophical tradition that has its roots in the thought of people like David Hume, Edmund Burke and Alexander Hamilton, a tradition of thought that sits in the tension between humility and audacity, fair-mindedness and compassion. Like all Times journalists I’m committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.

The Harris-Cheney Partnership Is Not Just a Marriage of Convenience
Unlikely friendships can make America a better place.
By David French
I’m a new kid on the block in Opinion. I joined in January 2023, and while I write on a wide range of topics, a common theme is that I like to explore the story behind the story. What are the reasons for American polarization and dysfunction? Why do so many Americans feel lonely and anxious? Why is religious affiliation in such sharp decline? I’m just as likely to write about faith, friendship, marriage and parenting as I am to write about the war in Ukraine or the latest developments in American constitutional law. I also write quite a bit about religion in America, with a particular focus on the health of the evangelical church.
I took a long and winding road to journalism. I was born in Alabama, grew up in a small town in Kentucky, attended Lipscomb University in Nashville, and graduated from Harvard Law School. I was a commercial litigator for a number of years, and then ultimately switched to constitutional law. In 1999, I took a brief detour from my litigation career and served as a lecturer at Cornell Law School.
In 2006, I obtained an age waiver from the Army and joined the JAG Corps as an Army lawyer. After dragging my old body through basic training, I volunteered to deploy to Iraq and served with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Diyala Province during the height of the Surge in 2007. I was awarded a Bronze Star.
During my litigation career, I worked for both commercial and public interest law firms and was a former president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. I spent most of my career defending free speech, religious freedom and due process in courtrooms across the country.
After 21 years of legal practice, I changed careers. In 2015, I joined National Review as a senior writer, but left in 2019 to help start The Dispatch, a conservative media company. I also became a contributing writer for The Atlantic. In 2023, I joined The Times.
If there were a Nerd Olympics, I might take the gold medal. If you want recommendations on sci-fi or fantasy books or movies — or the definitive rankings of Star Wars movies — please ask. I’d be happy to answer, at length.
My most recent book, “Divided We Fall: America’s Secession Threat and How to Restore Our Nation,” outlined the dangers of polarization and the need to engage with people who have opposing viewpoints. I’m an evangelical conservative who believes strongly in a classical liberal, pluralistic vision of American democracy, in which people with deep religious, cultural, and moral differences can live and work together and enjoy equal legal protection and shared cultural tolerance. In both my personal and professional life I strive to live up to the high ideals of Micah 6:8 — to act justly, to love kindness, and to walk humbly before God.
I live in Tennessee.
I’m an opinion writer, but I’m not a polemicist. My goals are to treat opposing arguments fairly, to make sure that my facts are correct, that my analysis is sound, and to be transparent about gaps in my knowledge or limitations in my understanding. I believe in admitting mistakes and telling readers when I change my mind, and why. I think personal and professional transparency is important. If we ask readers to trust us, then they deserve to know us.
I follow the Times’s Ethical Journalism Handbook. I disclose potential conflicts of interest, and when I’m in doubt about any potential ethical question, I seek guidance from my editors in much the same way that a lawyer with ethical concerns seeks guidance from the bar association.

‘Crazy’ Is Beginning to Sound Like an Understatement
Election Day can’t come soon enough.
By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens
I’ve always tried to use humor to get readers interested in the political issues of the day — or in the current era, maybe just less depressed.
After graduate school in Massachusetts, I moved to Connecticut, where my husband had a job in New Haven. Couldn’t find a regular reporting gig, so I contacted all the weekly and small daily papers to see if they wanted coverage of their state legislators. At the time, there were tons of potential clients — most closed now, alas. I wound up sending several stories a week to each of them, giving me a good background in state government and extremely speedy typing skills.
I moved on to cover local government for United Press International and New York Newsday. I joined The Times in 1995 as an editorial board member, then columnist, then editorial page editor. I left that wonderful job to go back to writing columns. I’ve also written a bunch of books, most on women’s history.
Most politicians and other sources I’ve dealt with have been aware of The Times’s strong honor code, and I can’t, to be honest, remember any unethical offer that was even vaguely tempting.
Don’t think I’ve ever sought out any personal favors from politicians, except an ongoing attempt to get the city to fix the broken sidewalk on my block. And I’m proud to say that after years of effort, the cracks are still there.

We’ve Just Had a Glimpse of the World to Come
Last week’s BRICS summit showed how the balance of global power increasingly eludes the West’s grasp.
By Lydia Polgreen
I write about the world, culture and politics, with an emphasis on human rights, migration, queer lives and democracy. Above all I am interested in the experiences of human beings as they navigate the interlocking crises of our time.
I spent a decade as an international correspondent for The Times in West Africa, South Asia and South Africa. I have also worked as a media executive, serving as editor in chief of HuffPost and managing director of Gimlet, a podcast studio at Spotify. Before joining The Times, I was a staff writer for The Orlando Sentinel and The Times Union in Albany, New York.
My mother is Ethiopian and my father was American, and I spent most of my childhood and a good chunk of my professional life in Africa. These experiences inform my perspective and work, which aims to look at global events and the United States from perspectives other than those of the rich, western world.
I attended Saint John’s College, earning a bachelor-of-arts degree in philosophy and mathematics, as well as Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. I am proud to have won a number of awards for my reporting over the years, including the Polk and the Livingston awards for international reporting.
I live in New York City with my wife and two dogs.
Human dignity is at the core of my work. I often write about vulnerable and marginalized people, and I try to take special care to ensure my reporting and writing do not cause them harm. I always strive to tell stories with nuance and respect. I am an opinion columnist and write about my views and convictions, but I am deeply committed to independence, rigorous reporting and accuracy. My work is informed by my life experiences and, whenever possible, the lived experiences of people I have met and spoken to in depth, as well as things I have been able to witness first hand.
Columnists abide by the same rigorous ethical standards as all Times journalists to ensure our independence and credibility. You can read more about The Times’s ethics guidelines.

How Bad Do You Want It, Ladies?
Donald, your insecurity is showing.
By Maureen Dowd
I focus mostly on presidential politics but I like to branch out and write about New York, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and occasionally, European politics. I love to cover the arc of women’s victories and setbacks in American life. I like to write with humor, but given all the impeachments, indictments, coups and villainy I have to cover, it’s hard to do it as often as I’d like.
I started at The Washington Star in 1973, working as a clerk on the overnight shift, taking dictation from reporters covering the Watergate trial in the days before cellphones and laptops. I became a city reporter in 1975. When the Star folded in 1981, I went to Time magazine for a couple years. Then the great Anna Quindlen hired me for the city desk of The New York Times in 1983. I transferred to Washington, my hometown, in 1986, and covered the Bush I and Clinton White Houses before becoming a columnist in 1995. I received the Pulitzer Prize in 1999 for distinguished commentary and have written several books, including “Bushworld,” which covered the presidency and personality of George W. Bush, and “Are Men Necessary? When Sexes Collide,” about gender politics. I have also written for GQ, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, The New Republic, Mademoiselle, Sports Illustrated and elsewhere.
I got an undergraduate degree from Catholic University and, in 2023, a Master’s Degree in English Literature from Columbia University.

Why This Senate Candidate Is a Potential ‘Shock to the System’
Michelle Goldberg went to Nebraska and found political hope in an independent.
By Michelle Goldberg and Jillian Weinberger
I write about politics and culture from a left-leaning, feminist point of view, though I try to seek out stories that challenge my preconceptions. I’m particularly interested in the rise of authoritarianism in both America and around the world, the state of the progressive movement and the evolution of gender relations. You can sign up to receive email alerts when my column publishes.
Before I joined The Times, I was a columnist at Slate, and my work has appeared in The New Yorker, The Washington Post, The Nation, The New Republic and many other publications.
My first book, “Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism,” was about religious authoritarianism in American politics, a subject I’ve been reporting on ever since. It was a finalist for the Helen Bernstein Award for Excellence in Journalism. After that, I traveled to countries including India, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, and Poland to write “The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power and the Future of the World,” a book about global battles over gender and reproductive rights, which won the J. Anthony Lukas Work-In-Progress Award and the Ernesta Drinker Ballard Book Prize. Next, in a detour from politics, I wrote “The Goddess Pose,” a book about wellness culture and the long Western fascination with Eastern spirituality as refracted through the story of the peripatetic Russian yoga evangelist Indra Devi.
In 2018, I was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for reporting on issues of workplace sexual harassment. That year I also won a Front Page Award from the Newswomen’s Club of New York for opinion/criticism. In 2020, I won the Hillman Prize for opinion and analysis.
I grew up near Buffalo, New York, earned my undergraduate degree at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and then received a masters of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. I’m an on-air contributor at MSNBC and live with my family in Brooklyn.
As an opinion columnist, I don’t claim to be objective: My politics inform most of what I write. But I do strive, always, to be accurate and fair. In addition to getting my facts right — or running a correction if I don’t — that means never quoting people out of context, or omitting important information that might cut against an argument that I’m making. I don’t accept speaking engagements or payments of any kind from political organizations, and I make sure to disclose potential conflicts of interest. (To that end, I should note that the company my husband works for is consulting on the Harris/Walz campaign’s organizing program.) Like all Times journalists, I’m committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.

Don’t Let Liberal Purity Elect Trump
Even if you think Harris is flawed on the Middle East, don’t try to punish the Democratic Party and risk a Trump election.
By Nicholas Kristof
I often report from around the world, but I’m also very interested in how we fix the rifts in America and help the tens of millions of people who have been left behind at home. I try to shine a light on topics that aren’t necessarily in the headlines but should be. I have a longstanding interest in health, poverty and women’s rights, partly because of a book that my wife, Sheryl WuDunn, and I wrote on empowering women called “Half the Sky,” and partly because the most consequential article I ever wrote was one in 1997 that led Bill and Melinda Gates on the path to embracing global health as a focus for their foundation.
I live on the family farm in rural Oregon that I grew up on, and more than a quarter of the kids on my old school bus have died from drugs, alcohol and suicide. That has seared and shaped me as much as my Harvard education or Oxford studies as a Rhodes Scholar. After a law degree and then Arabic studies in Cairo, I joined The Times in 1984, working as bureau chief in Hong Kong, Beijing and Tokyo before becoming a columnist in 2001. My wife and I jointly won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in China, and I won a second Pulitzer for coverage of the Darfur genocide. I also picked up an Emmy for a video about Covid. I’ve written a number of books; my next one is a memoir called “Chasing Hope.” Oh, and on the side, I backpack, run (including, briefly, for Oregon governor) and make Kristof Farms hard cider.
When you begin your journalism career in a tiny town, you see the impact on individuals when your coverage wounds them. So I deeply believe in tough journalism, but not at the expense of fairness. I try to reach out to people I’m going to criticize, saying something like: “I think I’m going to take a whack at you in my column and would like to hear what you have to say.” I try to dig deep and use my column to spotlight issues that deserve a place on the public agenda, for I’m very conscious that journalism is a responsibility and can make a real difference — if we’re fair and win the public trust. All Times staff are also, of course, governed by conflict-of-interest rules in The Times’s Ethical Journalism Handbook.
The best way to reach me is through my assistant, Spencer Cohen, spencer.cohen@nytimes.com. I do read incoming messages, but I don’t always have time to respond to messages.

There’s No Escape at the Movies
Watching “Conclave” and “Rumours,” I realized I couldn’t escape the real world after all.
By Pamela Paul
I’m interested in how ideas spread throughout culture and society and in how they evolve. I’ve written about everything from literature to theater, Nikki Haley to Joe Biden, the Cultural Revolution to Colleen Hoover, “American Dirt” to Robert Caro, cashless retail to gun control. I write from the perspective of a lifelong liberal. It’s from this place that I often write about illiberal progressive orthodoxies, in particular around identity, language, morality, gender ideology, class and free speech.
Most recently, I was the editor of The New York Times Book Review, but I’ve been working since I was 14, and my varied experiences — as a cashier in a supermarket and a sales clerk in retail, a waitress in New York, a wine server in French Catalonia, a librarian and high school teacher in Chiang Mai, Thailand, an ice cream scooper in Paris, a caterer in college — informs everything I do. I studied history at Brown University.
I worked on the business side in media throughout my twenties, in publishing, television and documentary film. I began my journalism career as a correspondent in London and New York for The Economist where I covered global arts, film and books. As a freelancer, I was a contributor to Time magazine and was a columnist for The Times’s Styles section. I often wrote about science, health, family, the workplace, culture and demographic and consumer trends.
I joined The Times in 2011 as the children’s book editor and became the editor of the Book Review in 2013 as well as host of the weekly Book Review podcast. I began overseeing all books coverage in 2016 and joined Opinion as a columnist in 2022. In addition to a weekly column, I occasionally write longer pieces, most recently on pediatric cancer.
I am the author or editor of eight books: “Rectangle Time,” “How to Raise a Reader “(co-author), “My Life with Bob: Flawed Heroine Keeps Book of Books, Plot Ensues,” “The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony,” “Pornified,” “Parenting, Inc.” and “By the Book: Writers on Literature and the Literary Life.” My most recent book is “100 Things We’ve Lost to the Internet.” I have two forthcoming picture books, “It Simply Can’t Be Bedtime!” (2025) and “The Path” (2027).
Coming from a decade in the newsroom and two decades as a freelance writer, I apply those same standards and rigor to my work as an Opinion columnist. I always write what I believe to be accurate and true, even if it means presenting facts and opinions that challenge readers rather than reaffirm their preconceptions or preferences. I strive to write about complicated issues with clarity, nuance and sensitivity. I never blurb books. I avoid or disclose potential conflicts. I prefer to express my opinions on platforms other than social media. You can read this to learn more about our ethical guidelines.

A ‘Glorious’ Economy
The economy is a remarkable success, even if Biden and Harris aren’t getting credit for it.
By Paul Krugman
Most of my writing involves economics, but I weigh in on other issues such as technology, global politics or domestic policy, when I think I can add something to the discussion. I also write a weekly newsletter.
I’m an economist by training, with an original focus on international trade and finance, who taught at M.I.T. and Princeton University among other places, and am now a distinguished professor at City University of New York Graduate Center.
My pre-Times research was honored, among other things, with the 2008 Nobel Prize in economics. I am the author (or editor) of 27 books, and I am one of the founders of the “new trade theory,” a major rethinking of international trade that explains the emergence of new trade patterns between countries, based, in part, on how consumers started to seek out different brands for everyday products. I received my undergraduate degree at Yale University and my Ph.D. in economics from M.I.T. I grew up in Albany, N.Y.
I rely almost entirely on public information, rather than insider access. I try to get my facts right, try to listen to multiple views, and make a point of admitting when I got something wrong. I have no financial stake in anything I write, and no connection with any political campaign. You can learn more about The Times’s ethics guidelines here.

How the Two Biggest Cities in the U.S. Watched the World Series
Visuals by Jeenah Moon and Yun Ye
Text by David Waldstein
Oct. 29, 2024
The languid rhythms of summer baseball are often enjoyed alone, on a front porch with a transistor radio or on a living room couch, beer in hand. Autumn baseball, on the other hand, is communal.
When the games really matter, especially in the World Series, some fans, and even casual observers, prefer to watch with others, to cheer together, to hope, pray, and sometimes weep on a comforting shoulder.
This year’s World Series, between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers, features two of the most prominent teams in American sports and is being hosted in the two largest cities in the country.
Jeenah Moon for The New York Times
Legions of passionate fans on both sides have found ways to watch together, even when they are thousands of miles from the fans inside the stadiums.
Viewing parties popped up in bars and restaurants, including some that might not ordinarily show sporting events, like eateries in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. Fans gathered to watch there, and in the back of a New York deli, but also outside, or wherever large video screens beamed the games to folks in search of a group setting.
They watched in the city centers, at tourist attractions and at home in Manhattan and in Manhattan Beach.
They watched in the city centers, at tourist attractions and at home in Manhattan and in Manhattan Beach.
Yun Ye for The New York Times
Yun Ye for The New York Times
With the advent of streaming on mobile devices, fans can check in from almost anywhere: a cash register at a bodega; on the A train platform under Times Square; in line at an ATM; or at a boutique in L.A.
The last time these teams met in a World Series was in 1981, when fans would gather around a black-and-white TV on a pizzeria counter or at the end of a string of extension cords running out to the stoop of an apartment building. Some dawdled outside appliance stores to watch the game on dozens of TVs on display.
Jeenah Moon for The New York Times
Yun Ye for The New York Times
The rivalry dates to the 1940s, when the Dodgers were in Brooklyn. When the teams met in the World Series in 1978, the Dodgers’ 21st season in Los Angeles, an average of 44 million people watched each game across the country.
Yun Ye for The New York Times; Yun Ye for The New York Times
This year, viewership is up, bucking the recent trend. The last four World Series were the least-viewed Fall Classics in the last 50 years.
Yun Ye for The New York Times
Last year, when the Texas Rangers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games, an average of about nine million viewers watched each game. For Game 1 of this year's Series, there were over 14 million viewers.
Yun Ye for The New York Times
Jeenah Moon for The New York Times
And now that the Dodgers have Shohei Ohtani, the superstar slugger and pitcher from Japan, a record number are watching in Japan, too. Game 2, which took place in the Japanese morning, averaged 15.9 million viewers there over the length of the broadcast, the most ever for a postseason Major League Baseball game.
Jeenah Moon for The New York Times
The Yankees crushing the Dodgers in Game 4 kept hope alive. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a World Series, so the chances are slim. But for one more day, at least, fans on both coasts can tune in, whether on a giant screen with scores of likeminded comrades, or on a little phone in the back of a bus.

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/podcasts/serial-productions.html:

Serial Productions makes narrative podcasts whose quality and innovation transformed the medium.
We launched the “Serial” podcast in 2014 as a spinoff of the revered public radio show “This American Life.” The series was an instant, unprecedented hit and set a new standard for investigative audio reporting and storytelling. We followed that up with “S-Town,” another blockbuster, and Serial Productions was born.
In 2020, after releasing two more seasons of the “Serial” podcast, we joined The New York Times Company. Together with The Times, we launched “Nice White Parents,” a provocative series about the powerful forces shaping public schools; “The Improvement Association,” a true story about election fraud in North Carolina; and “The Trojan Horse Affair,” an investigation into the mystery at the heart of a scandal that rocked Britain.
Our shows have reached many millions of listeners, and have won nearly every major journalism award for audio, including the first-ever Peabody Award given to a podcast.
We continue to experiment with the podcast form, making deeply reported stories that feel surprising, emotional and personal. We're currently at work on a slate of new shows, releasing throughout the year.
Serial
Season 4
“Serial” returns with a history of Guantánamo told by people who lived through key moments in Guantánamo’s evolution, who know things the rest of us don’t about what it’s like to be caught inside an improvised justice system.
The Kids of Rutherford County
For over a decade, one Tennessee county arrested and illegally jailed hundreds, maybe thousands, of children. A four-part narrative series reveals how this came to be, the adults responsible for it, and the two lawyers, former juvenile delinquents themselves, who try to do something about it. Hosted by Nashville Public Radio reporter Meribah Knight. Produced by Serial Productions and The New York Times, in partnership with Nashville Public radio and ProPublica.
The Retrievals
Hundreds of women underwent egg retrieval procedures at the Yale Fertility Center. For months they complained of severe pain. But nobody caught on to exactly what was wrong. A five-part series about the patients who say their pain was dismissed, a nurse who was hiding something, and the institution that failed to protect its patients. Hosted by veteran This American Life producer Susan Burton. Produced by Serial Productions and The New York Times.
The Coldest
Case In Laramie
Kim Barker, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter for The New York Times, revisits an unsolved murder that took place while she was in high school in Laramie, Wyoming, nearly 40 years ago. She confronts the conflicting stories people have told themselves about the crime because of an unexpected development: the arrest of a former Laramie police officer accused in the murder.
We Were Three
When Rachel McKibbens’s father and brother died suddenly last fall, two weeks apart, from Covid, she’d had no idea her father was sick, and no idea her brother was dying. They were unvaccinated, but the story of what happened started long before that. Hosted by Nancy Updike, We Were Three is a story of lies, family, America, and what Covid revealed, as well as what it destroyed.
The Trojan
Horse Affair
A strange letter explodes in the British press in 2014, outlining a supposed Islamist plot to infiltrate public schools in Britain. A national panic ensues, resulting in new national policies, multiple investigations, banned educators and revamped schools. But despite the chaos the letter caused, no one ever discovered its author. Brian Reed and Hamza Syed team up to figure out who wrote the letter, and the stunning reason why.
The Improvement
Association
The leader of a powerful African-American voting bloc in rural North Carolina invites political reporter Zoe Chace to come down to Bladen County to investigate the power of election fraud allegations — even when they’re not substantiated.
Nice White
Parents
We know American public schools do not guarantee each child an equal education; two decades of school reform initiatives have not changed that. But most of those reforms have focused on the population that schools are failing — Black and brown kids. So reporter Chana Joffe-Walt decides to ask a different question: Who, then, are public schools catering to?
S-Town
Reporter Brian Reed gets an email out of the blue from a man named John who despises his Alabama town. He says the son of a wealthy local family allegedly had been bragging that he got away with murder, and John wants the reporter to investigate. But then someone else dies, leading to a nasty feud, a hunt for hidden treasure and an examination into the mysteries of one man’s life.
Serial
Season 3
Sarah Koenig and Emmanuel Dzotsi spent a year inside a typical felony courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio. They reported on cases of every size, from marijuana cookies to assault to homicide. They ended up with extraordinary stories of ordinary American justice.
Serial
Season 2
In 2009, a young soldier from Idaho, Bowe Bergdahl, walked off his remote outpost in Afghanistan and disappeared into the mountains. Captured by the Taliban, Bergdahl would be held in harsh conditions for nearly five years — our sole prisoner of war. Why did he decide to walk away? And how did the consequences of that one idiosyncratic decision spin out? Hosted by Sarah Koenig.
Serial
Season 1
A reinvestigation of a 1999 murder case in Baltimore, in which a young man named Adnan Syed was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for killing his former girlfriend, a fellow high school senior named Hae Min Lee. But it’s not at all clear he’s actually guilty. Hosted by Sarah Koenig, the show became a cultural phenomenon, launching podcasts into the mainstream. Adnan Syed was freed from prison eight years later.

Opinion
Donald
Trump’s
First Term
Is a
Warning
Republicans have tried to rewrite the four years of Trump’s presidency as a time of unparalleled peace, prosperity and tranquility: “the strongest economy in history,” as Senator Katie Britt of Alabama put it during the Republican National Convention. The difference between Trump and Biden? “President Trump honored the Constitution,” said Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota. Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia offered Mr. Trump’s first term as an example of “common-sense conservative leadership.”
The record of what Mr. Trump actually did in office bears little resemblance to that description. Under his leadership, the country lurched from one crisis to the next, from the migrant families separated at the border to the sudden spike in prices caused by his trade war with China to the reckless mismanagement of the Covid pandemic. And he showed, over and over, how little respect he has for the Constitution and those who take an oath to defend it.
For Americans who may have forgotten that time, or pushed it from memory, we offer this timeline of his presidency. Mr. Trump’s first term was a warning about what he will do with the power of his office — unless American voters reject him.

01.21.2017: “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period.” On Mr. Trump’s first day in office, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, accuses the media of deliberately understating the size of the crowd on the National Mall, claiming — falsely — that Mr. Trump’s was the most-attended inauguration in history.
01.25.2017: Tries to defund sanctuary cities in an effort to ramp up deportations. On his fifth day in office, Mr. Trump signs a sweeping executive order focused on immigration that includes measures to withhold funds from cities whose law enforcement agencies don’t comply with federal immigration authorities. The order is later blocked in court.
01.27.2017: The Muslim ban. In an executive order, Mr. Trump closes the U.S. border to refugees fleeing war in Syria, as well as from several mostly Muslim countries. The ban is put in place with no warning, sending airports across the country into chaos and confusion.
01.28.2017: Appoints Steve Bannon, a committed dismantler of the administrative state, to the National Security Council. Mr. Bannon, a far-right agitator, is named to a council usually reserved for generals and intelligence officials, whose decisions are meant to be separate from political considerations.
02.15.2017: Abandons a decades-long commitment to a two-state solution in a news conference. Standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump reverses a long-held position by the United States that any peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians must include a Palestinian state alongside Israel — startling the diplomatic community. “There is no Plan B to a two-state solution,” the U.N. secretary general says afterward. “Everything must be done to preserve that possibility.”
03.04.2017: Claims to have been wiretapped by the U.S. government. In a series of early morning tweets, Mr. Trump makes unsubstantiated claims about being surveilled by the Obama administration during the campaign.
05.09.2017: Fires the F.B.I. director, James Comey, who was leading an investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. In a letter, Mr. Trump claims he is acting at the behest of members of his administration who thought Mr. Comey treated Hillary Clinton unfairly. Mr. Comey finds out about his dismissal through news reports.
05.10.2017: Reveals highly classified intelligence to Russian officials. In an Oval Office meeting, Mr. Trump reportedly reveals sufficient information to endanger cooperation with the source of the intelligence, which was about a planned Islamic State operation. “I get great intel,” he boasts to the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. “I have people brief me on great intel every day.”
June 2017: Rages against immigrants, saying those from Haiti all have AIDS. In a meeting with cabinet officials, Mr. Trump ignites over the number of foreigners entering the country under his tenure.
June 2017: Tries to fire the special counsel Robert Mueller over the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump claims, among other reasons, that Mr. Mueller has a conflict of interest, because of a 2011 dispute over fees at the Trump National Golf Club. Mr. Trump backs down after the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, threatens to resign.
06.21.2017: Sends his son-in-law to negotiate Middle East peace. Jared Kushner, who has already been granted a sizable policy portfolio in the White House, goes to Israel to take on one of the world’s most intractable conflicts. He has no prior experience in diplomacy or foreign policy.
07.26.2017: Announces a ban on transgender people in the military. Active-duty service members get the news on Twitter, leaving many unsure of their status. The ban is challenged in court.
08.15.2017: “You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.” Mr. Trump makes his infamous comments after white nationalist groups hold a march in Charlottesville, Va., that involves waving Confederate flags and swastikas and chants of “Jews will not replace us.” One person died, and dozens were injured at the rally.
08.21.2017: Everyone knows that you should never stare directly at the sun during an eclipse, right? Nope.
10.03.2017: Throws paper towels to Puerto Ricans after a deadly hurricane. Mr. Trump visits Puerto Rico two weeks after Hurricane Maria, when more than 90 percent of the island is still without electricity and some remote areas lack food, water and medical aid. The death toll in Puerto Rico from Maria eventually reaches around 3,000.
12.06.2017: Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, upending decades of U.S. policy. The status of Jerusalem was viewed an issue to be decided during peace talks. Mr. Trump says he is fulfilling a campaign promise made to, among others, evangelical voters and pro-Israel American Jews, like Sheldon Adelson, a major donor.
12.22.2017: Cuts taxes for corporations and the wealthy, sending the budget deficit skyrocketing. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act costs $1.5 trillion. From 2017 to 2018, the budget deficit grows 17 percent, largely driven by falling revenues.
01.06.2018: “A very stable genius.” Mr. Trump sends a set of Saturday morning tweets in response to the erratic and dimwitted portrait of him painted by Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury.” “Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart,” Mr. Trump writes.
01.11.2018: Wants more immigrants from Norway instead of “shithole” countries. Mr. Trump balks at a deal that would protect migrants from Haiti and Africa.
Winter 2018: Reaps financial benefits from a diplomatic crisis in the Persian Gulf. The governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar spend lavishly at Trump’s D.C. hotel while lobbying for the United States’ help resolving a standoff in the region. The Qataris and connected companies spend more than $300,000.
03.14.2018: Brags about making up facts in meetings with foreign leaders. At a private meeting with donors, he recounts telling Canada’s prime minister that the U.S. runs a trade deficit with its northern neighbor, even though Mr. Trump had “no idea” if this was true. (It wasn’t.)
04.15.2018: Flip-flops on sanctions for Russia over its role in Syria’s chemical weapons program. A proposal announced by Nikki Haley is immediately undercut through a phone call to the Russian Embassy. The whiplash is another marker of administration chaos.
Spring 2018: Tries to get the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Mr. Comey. Mr. McGahn, the White House counsel, refused. Mr. Trump has said that if re-elected, he will appoint a special prosecutor to “go after” his enemies, including Joe Biden and Mrs. Clinton.
Spring 2018: Initiates family separations by executive order. Thousands of migrant children, some of them as young as just a few months old, are taken from their parents, who are detained for crossing the border illegally. The process is disorganized; efforts to reunite families are ongoing.
May 2018: Orders top-secret clearance for Mr. Kushner, over the objections of intelligence officials. Mr. Trump overrules concerns, then claims he had no role in the decision.
May 2018: Closes pandemic preparedness unit. The Trump White House abolishes the position of director for global health security and biodefense in the National Security Council less than two years before the Covid pandemic. Mr. Biden has created a pandemic preparedness unit, but Mr. Trump says he would abolish it again if re-elected.
05.08.2018: Unilaterally pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal. In 2019, after efforts to salvage the deal, Iran resumes high-level uranium enrichment; officials warn it now has enough material to make several nuclear bombs with further enrichment.
06.04.2018: “I have the absolute right to PARDON myself ....” Mr. Trump publicly floats the idea of pardoning himself, something he has reportedly been pondering since 2017. (Constitutional scholars do not agree on whether presidents may pardon themselves.)
Summer 2018: Escalates the trade war with China, which requires billions of dollars to fix the domestic damage. Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods immediately hurt American farmers, so he has to spend $12 billion to help them. “You have a terrible policy that sends farmers to the poorhouse, and then you put them on welfare, and we borrow the money from other countries,” says Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee.
07.11.2018: Insults NATO allies. At a meeting of an alliance Mr. Trump has long disparaged, he accuses Germany of being “captive” to Russia and calls U.S. allies “delinquent.” Days later, he calls the European Union a “foe.”
07.16.2018: Sides with Vladimir Putin over American intelligence agencies on Russian election interference. Standing next to Russia’s president at a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump says he got an “extremely strong and powerful” denial from Mr. Putin that his country had tried to influence the U.S. election. A reporter asks, “Who do you believe?” “I have President Putin. He just said it’s not Russia,” Mr. Trump responds, adding, “I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”
09.13.2018: Lies about hurricane deaths. Angry about criticism of his response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017, Mr. Trump denies that nearly 3,000 people died. “This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible,” he tweets. “I love Puerto Rico!”
10.24.2018: Continues to use his personal iPhones after warnings that they are not secure. Aides repeatedly tell Mr. Trump that Russian and Chinese spies are often listening to his phone calls. He keeps using the phones anyway.
11.10.2018: Calls American soldiers “losers” and “suckers.” Mr. Trump balks at visiting a cemetery dedicated to U.S. war dead near Paris, reportedly out of concern that the rain would leave his hair disheveled and asking, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.”
12.22.2018: Instigates the longest government shutdown ever. Mr. Trump demands $5.7 billion to pay for his border wall but can’t reach a deal with Congress for the money. More than 420,000 essential government workers, including Border Patrol officers, work without pay for 35 days, including the December holidays. The shutdown ends with him receving no border wall money.
12.28.2018: The E.P.A. proposes weakening regulations on power plants that restrict the release of mercury, which can cause brain damage. The chief executive of Murray Energy Corporation requested the rollback of the mercury rule soon after Mr. Trump took office.
02.14.2019: Moves to appoint a climate change denier to lead a climate security panel. William Happer, the appointee, has said, “More CO2 will benefit the world,” and once compared the “demonization” of CO2 to the treatment of Jews under Hitler.
02.15.2019: Declares national emergency to get money for border wall. After his shutdown fails to secure border wall funding from Congress, Mr. Trump pursues an emergency declaration that allows him to move money from other accounts, raising questions about the constitutional separation of powers.
March 2019: Suggests shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down. Aides tell him this is illegal.
03.20.2019: Continues to attack John McCain after his death. “I’ve never liked him much,” Mr. Trump tells an Ohio crowd, seven months after the senator’s death.
03.22.2019: Reverses North Korea sanctions by tweet … maybe. “It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea,” Mr. Trump tweets. “I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!” In addition to the policy muddle he generates by overruling his own Treasury Department, there is confusion over what sanctions he is referring to: No new North Korea sanctions were announced the day of his tweets.
05.24.2019: Proposes ending federal health rights protections for transgender people. A new federal rule attempts to eliminate protections for trans patients against discrimination in the health care system. It is blocked by a federal judge a day before it is set to take effect.
06.12.2019: Says he would accept opposition research from Russia. Asked what he would do if a foreign government offered incriminating information about an opponent, Mr. Trump says, “I think I’d take it.” Would he tell the F.B.I.? He says he might not.
06.29.2019: Takes his daughter to a G20 summit. A video clip of Ivanka Trump awkwardly trying to jump into a conversation with four world leaders goes viral, spawning a hashtag: #UnwantedIvanka.
06.30.2019: Steps into North Korea. Mr. Trump’s almost complete embrace of Kim Jong-un after initially promising fire and fury results in no progress in reducing North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. In the months after the visit, North Korea continues to test-launch missiles.
07.25.2019: Pressures Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for “a favor”: to investigate Mr. Biden’s activities in the country. Days before he talks with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump orders his acting chief of staff to put a hold on almost $400 million of military aid intended for the country to combat Russian aggression. “The United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,” Mr. Trump reminds Mr. Zelensky during the conversation.
08.20.2019: Cancels a state visit to Denmark after the country says it won’t sell him Greenland. He takes offense at the Danish prime minister’s comments that the suggestion is “absurd.” “You don’t talk to the United States that way,” Mr. Trump says.
08.21.2019: Proposes regulation that would allow indefinite detention of migrant families. A federal judge rejects the defense of the regulations as “Kafkaesque.”
09.04.2019: Insists, over meteorologists’ objections, that Alabama will be hit by Hurricane Dorian. Possibly alters a map from NOAA to prove he’s right. After Mr. Trump’s statements, the National Weather Service clarifies that its forecasts do not put Alabama in Dorian’s path; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rebukes the Weather Service, then comes under fire from the scientific community for seemingly massaging its meteorology for political purposes. The map incident comes to be known as Sharpiegate; Dorian does not reach Alabama.
11.18.2019: Reverses four decades of U.S. policy by declaring that Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate international law. Over 9,000 new Israeli homes are built in the West Bank during the Trump administration, according to The Associated Press. In February 2024 the Biden administration reverses the U.S. stance again, declaring the settlements “inconsistent with international law.”
12.18.2019: Becomes the third president in the history of the United States to be impeached, on charges related to Mr. Trump’s interactions with Mr. Zelensky. Testimony during the impeachment process makes clear that the Trump administration made the release of military aid contingent on Mr. Zelensky making a public statement about an investigation into Mr. Biden, possibly on CNN. Mr. Trump is acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.
01.17.2020: Rolls back school nutrition rules promoted by Michelle Obama — fewer vegetables, more pizza. Some experts argue the changes, which seem likely to increase the number of french fries consumed by students, were driven by the potato lobby.
01.28.2020: Announces a Middle East peace plan that heavily favors Israel. The plan would give Israel most of what it has sought, including West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as its capital, in exchange for a Palestinian state with no standing army and no right of return. The plan is celebrated by Israeli hard-liners and immediately denounced by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority.
02.28.2020: Downplays Covid-19. Mr. Trump blames the media for “doing everything they can to instill fear in people” and says Democrats are pushing the danger of the virus as “their new hoax.” Later a book by the journalist Bob Woodward makes clear that in a private interview in February, Mr. Trump called the virus “deadly.”
March 2020: Botches the early Covid-19 response — sometimes deliberately. The White House Covid response coordinator, Deborah Birx, later tells a House subcommittee investigating Mr. Trump’s response that the White House purposely tried to discourage testing to obscure the virus’s rapid spread and that the White House did not contact companies to supply Covid tests more than a month into the pandemic, among other failings.
04.04.2020: Pushes hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, as a Covid treatment. “What do you have to lose?” he asks. Prescriptions surge.
04.23.2020: Pushes bleach, which is toxic to humans, as a Covid treatment. Reports to poison control of accidental disinfectant poisoning spike in the following days.
05.07.2020: Pressures the Justice Department into dropping a Russia-related case against his former national security adviser. The adviser, Michael Flynn, already pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his contact with a Russian diplomat during the transition. Mr. Trump later pardons him.
06.01.2020: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” In the midst of protests over George Floyd’s murder, Mr. Trump tweets a slogan seemingly advocating violence against Black Lives Matter protesters.
July 2020: Defends Confederate flag. “When people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism. They love their flag. It represents the South,” he says in an interview.
08.19.2020:
Praises QAnon at a news conference. “I heard that these are people that love our country,” he says. Asked about the QAnon theory that he is saving the nation from a satanic cult of child sex traffickers, he asks, “Is that supposed to be a bad thing?”
09.23.2020: Refuses to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. “We’re going to have to see what happens,” Mr. Trump says at a news conference. The next day he says he can’t be sure the election will be “honest.”
09.26.2020: Hosts a Covid-19 superspreader event at the White House. Mr. Trump hosts a nomination ceremony for Judge Amy Coney Barrett in the Rose Garden, followed by a reception in the White House. At least 11 people who attend the event, including the president and first lady, later get Covid.
09.29.2020: “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.” Asked during a presidential debate to disavow the white supremacist group, Mr. Trump instead addresses its members directly. Proud Boys celebrate.
10.07.2020: Receives an experimental Covid treatment not yet widely available, calls it a “cure.” Mr. Trump is granted access to a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies before it is available to the general public and calls it a “cure” that will be distributed free by the hundreds of thousands of doses. The biotech company Regeneron does not yet have F.D.A. approval for the treatment and says it anticipates initially having only 50,000 doses available.
10.07.2020: Pressures Attorney General Bill Barr to start a pre-election investigation into his political enemies. In a torrent of tweets, Mr. Trump demands that Mr. Barr indict Joe Biden, Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama. “Where are all of the arrests?” Mr. Trump asks.
11.04.2020: Lies about winning the election. “Frankly, we did win this election,” Mr. Trump says at the White House around 2 a.m., a few hours after polls close. With millions of ballots left to count in several closely contested states, he adds, “We want all voting to stop.”
11.09.2020: Fires the defense secretary in the wake of his election loss. Secretary Mark Esper, among other disagreements, opposed Mr. Trump’s demand that troops be deployed to American cities in the summer of 2020. Mr. Esper’s firing raises alarms about what plans Mr. Trump has in mind for the military in the final weeks of his administration.
11.09.2020: Withholds briefings from Mr. Biden’s team. Mr. Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the outcome of the election means the incoming administration cannot get access to intelligence briefings to prepare for transition.
November 2020: Tries to overturn Michigan’s results. Mr. Trump’s pressure tactics to stop a crucial swing state from going to Mr. Biden include inviting Republican state lawmakers to the White House and calling two Republican county election officials to urge them not to vote for certification of Mr. Biden’s victory.
12.19.2020: “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” In multiple tweets over weeks, Mr. Trump urges his supporters to meet at the Capitol on the day the vote is certified.
12.22.2020: Threatens to veto coronavirus aid. Mr. Trump suddenly denounces a bill to provide $900 billion in coronavirus relief — the result of months of bipartisan negotiations — as a “disgrace,” claiming to want bigger stimulus payments. He signs it less than a week later, having won almost no changes to the legislation.
12.23.2020: Vetoes annual military spending bill. Mr. Trump’s objects to parts of the bill, which provides the annual funding for the military, including a measure to rename military bases honoring Confederate generals. The Senate overrides his veto.
01.02.2021: Tries to overturn Georgia’s election result. “So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state,” Mr. Trump says. Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state and a Republican, refuses.
01.06.2021: Jan. 6. Mr. Trump’s lies about a stolen election culminate in a mob storming the Capitol, targeting his vice president, in order to stop the certification of the 2020 election. Mr. Trump takes no action for hours. At least seven people die in connection with the attack, and dozens of others are injured.
01.13.2021: Becomes the first president in the history of the United States to be impeached twice. The Senate falls 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to convict him of incitement of insurrection for his role in Jan. 6.

How a Judge Will Weigh Immunity in Trump’s Jan. 6 Case
In the next few months, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan will face what she herself recently called “a uniquely challenging” task. She will go line by line through the evidence the special counsel, Jack Smith, wants to present to a jury in support of his federal indictment charging former President Donald J. Trump on four criminal charges related to his plotting to overturn the 2020 election.
Her job is to determine which of myriad specific allegations about Mr. Trump’s actions can survive the Supreme Court’s recent ruling granting presidents a broad form of immunity from criminal prosecution for most of their official actions. Here is a look at the types of decisions Judge Chutkan will have to make, many times over.
If Mr. Trump undertook a specific action in his private capacity as a candidate for office, rather than in his role as the president, that act is deemed unofficial, according to the Supreme Court ruling. Such acts are not subject to immunity, so evidence about them can be cited in court to support the charges that Mr. Trump illegally tried to overturn the election, or even introduced as context to help a jury understand the case.
By contrast, if the action fell within what the Supreme Court referred to as the outer perimeter of presidential duties, it counts as official. In that case, it is entitled to, at a minimum, presumptive immunity, and the court must perform some additional analysis to decide whether it is off limits for any trial.
On matters like Mr. Trump’s attempts to strong-arm state officials into changing election results and his public lies that the election was stolen, prosecutors and defense attorneys are likely to disagree sharply about whether Mr. Trump was acting as a candidate who was seeking a new term in office, or as a president who was constitutionally charged with overseeing the enforcement of federal election laws.
Under the Supreme Court’s new doctrine, “official” actions by Mr. Trump would fall into one of two categories. Some official acts are core to the president’s exercise of executive power, in which case they are absolutely immune and no information about them can be used in his prosecution. Other official acts are more peripheral, in which case prosecutors might still be able to use information about them in court, depending on the circumstances.
The Supreme Court has already declared that Mr. Trump’s interactions with Justice Department officials count as core executive actions because the Constitution charges the president with overseeing federal law enforcement. Mr. Smith has removed discussion of his purported actions that fall into that category from the indictment.
A president’s peripheral official acts, the Supreme Court has said, are presumptively immune, too. But depending on the circumstances, exceptions can be made that would allow the information to still be part of a prosecution of that president.
The test is whether prosecuting a former president for such an action would pose a danger of intruding on the authority and functions of the executive branch, and therefore chilling future presidents from robustly carrying out their responsibilities. If not, then the act is not immune and evidence about it can be used in court.
The Supreme Court has said that Mr. Trump’s pressuring of then-Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as Senate president, to block the congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Electoral College victory was an official act but that it might fall into the exception, since the Constitution assigns no role to the president or executive branch in such proceedings.
Judge Chutkan won’t make any decisions on immunity until at least the end of October, when the defense and prosecution have finished submitting their own written assessments of the case. At that point, she could ask the two sides to flesh out their arguments further at a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington. Any determinations she makes on the question of immunity will almost certainly be appealed, likely eventually to the Supreme Court, which will have the final say of which parts of Mr. Trump’s indictment will have to be thrown out and which can survive and go to trial.

Where Are Trump and Harris Campaigning?
With time running out before Election Day on Nov. 5, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump are engaging in a blizzard of campaigning.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For the past two months, the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump (Task Force), led by Chairman Mike Kelly and Ranking Member Jason Crow, has been investigating the stunning security failures that occurred at the Donald Trump campaign rally on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Task Force has obtained information from an array of sources, including witnesses who testified at a Task Force hearing on September 26, 2024; a series of briefings from the United States Secret Service (USSS or Secret Service) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and 23 voluntary transcribed witness interviews of state and local law enforcement officials. The Task Force also obtained thousands of pages of documents in response to requests to federal, state, and local agencies. Chairman Kelly also issued three subpoenas to obtain sensitive documents from local agencies in Pennsylvania. Although the findings in this report are preliminary, the information obtained during the first phase of the Task Force's investigation clearly shows a lack of planning and coordination between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners before the rally. For instance, USSS did not give clear guidance to the relevant state and local agencies about managing areas outside the secure event perimeter, and there was no joint meeting on the day of the rally between USSS and all state and local law enforcement agencies assisting USSS. The information obtained by the Task Force also shows areas outside the secure perimeter were recognized as security risks-specifically the adjacent American Glass Research (AGR) property and building complex. Despite its proximity to a main road, clear sight lines to the stage, and elevated position, the Secret Service placed the AGR complex outside the secure perimeter for the event, meaning that the crowd that gathered there was not screened by USSS or other law enforcement. The consequences of that decision were compounded by the fact that state and local law enforcement posted near the complex did not have complete visual coverage of the area. While there was a local sniper team inside the AGR complex, they understood their assignment to be overwatch of the rally site-not securing the AGR roof and property. Accordingly, the local sniper teams inside the AGR complex had a narrow field of vision and were not positioned to monitor the areas where the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was spotted on the afternoon of July 13. Indeed, federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments. Throughout the afternoon, as Crooks's behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement and, eventually, climb on to the roof of the AGR Page 4
complex and fire eight shots at the rally stage and crowd, killing a rally attendee and injuring three others, including former President Trump. Crooks was neutralized by a Secret Service counter sniper. A local law enforcement officer also returned fire at Crooks. The autopsy shows Crooks died because of a single gunshot wound to the head. Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened. Page 5
OVERVIEW OF INVESTIGATION On July 24, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 1367 by a vote of 416-0. The resolution, introduced by Chairman Mike Kelly (R-PA), formally established and empowered the Task Force with investigating the attempted assassination of Donald J. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024. The resolution required House Committees to transfer relevant records to the Task Force within seven days, and the Committees of jurisdiction that began investigations in the immediate aftermath of July 13 did so. The Task Force has since leveraged that information, and the investigative authorities conferred by House Resolution 1367, to obtain evidence- -on a voluntary basis and in response to three subpoenas—from federal, state, and local agencies, including: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ● U.S. Secret Service Department of Justice (DOJ) • • Federal Bureau of Investigation • Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) • Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) • Butler County Department of Emergency Services (Butler EMS) • Butler County Sheriff's Office (Butler CSO) Butler Township Police Department (Butler Township) Butler County Emergency Services Unit (Butler ESU) Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (Beaver ESU) ● . Butler County Office of the Coroner • • Allegheny County Office of the Medical Examiner (ACOME) On August 26, 2024, the Task Force conducted a site visit to Butler, Pennsylvania and received a series of briefings from the relevant state and local agencies. The Task Force subsequently conducted 23 transcribed interviews with witnesses from state and local agencies, all of whom participated voluntarily. In August and September, the Task Force received a series of classified and non- classified briefings from senior Secret Service and FBI officials and obtained thousands of pages of documents from those and other agencies. On September 26, 2024, the Task Force held its first public hearing with witnesses from state and local law enforcement agencies and medical examiners. The Task Force's work is ongoing, and all the findings presented in this report are preliminary. Page 6
TABLE OF PHASE ONE FINDINGS Finding 1 There was inadequate planning and coordination TASK FORCE before the rally on July 13, 2024. TEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP TASK FORCE OF DONALD J. TRUMP ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION TASK FORCE MPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP There was no joint meeting between the Secret Service (USSS), state police, and local law enforcement (LLE) on the day of the rally. It remains unclear whether certain assignments were communicated by the USSS to LLE partners. USSS did not effectively verify responsibilities were understood and being executed. Finding 2 See, Advance Planning Failures, page 10 The AGR complex, and the surrounding area, were not part of the secure perimeter. Despite proximity to main road, clear sight lines to the stage, and its elevated overlook, the Secret Service placed the AGR complex outside the secure perimeter for the event, and the AGR complex was not otherwise secured. See, Secure Perimeter Did Not Include the AGR Complex, page 11 Finding 3 Local sniper teams inside the AGR complex had a narrow field of vision and were not positioned to monitor the AGR property. The sniper teams in the AGR complex understood their assignment to be limited to overwatch of the rally site, rather than securing the AGR buildings, AGR roof or the areas around the AGR complex. See, Local Tactical Team Positioning, page 16 Page 7
Finding 4 There was no unified command post to facilitate TASK FORCE communications between the Secret Service and its state and local partners. THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP There were two command posts on the day of the event. Though the Secret Service command post could have accommodated more people, key local law enforcement partners were in a separate trailer in a separate part of the vast Butler Farm Show property, and there was no dedicated radio link between law enforcement in the two posts. Finding 5 See, Separate Command Posts, page 20 Critical pieces of information about Crooks and the TASK FORCE escalating threat situation at the AGR complex moved EMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP TASK FORCE ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP slowly due to fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command on July 13. Moments before Crooks fired, a local law enforcement officer radioed that Crooks was on the roof with a gun. There is no evidence, to date, that this information reached the former President's detail, and he remained on stage. See, Timeline of Crooks' Movements, page 25 Finding 6 Testimony from local law enforcement indicates that they fired a shot at Crooks prior to the USSS sniper firing the kill shot. While the exact order of shots remains unclear, testimony from local law enforcement states that they took a shot in Crooks' direction, which may have caused Crooks to stop firing. See, Local Officer Returns Fire and Secret Service Counter Sniper Neutralizes Crooks, page 44 Page 8
TASK FORCE ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP TASK FORCE ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP Finding 7 Crooks did not use a ladder to access the AGR roof. Crooks did purchase a ladder on July 13, but he subsequently abandoned that ladder in a wooded area in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The ladder viewed in the widely circulated photographs of the AGR complex was placed by local law enforcement to access the roof after the assassination attempt. Finding 8 See, Ladder, page 45 The autopsy report indicates a single bullet killed Crooks. The report indicates a single entry wound on the upper left lip and a corresponding exit wound in the rear neck area. The wounds are consistent with a high velocity bullet from a distant range. There is no evidence of an entry wound from a second bullet. See, Autopsy and Toxicology Findings, page 48 Page 9
OVERVIEW OF PHASE ONE FINDINGS At a Task Force hearing on September 26, 2024, Chairman Mike Kelly stated: "In the days leading up to the rally, it was not a single mistake that allowed Crooks to outmaneuver one of our country's most elite group of security professionals. There were security failures on multiple fronts."¹ Ranking Member Jason Crow added: “It is clear that the Secret Service failed on July 13.”² He continued, stating: "The Secret Service must be expected to accomplish its zero-fail protection mission without any errors.” "3 The majority staff's preliminary findings from the first phase of the Task Force's investigation are broadly related to failures in advance planning (see Advance Planning Failures, page 10); decisions about mitigating dangerous lines of sight and positioning snipers and counter-snipers (see Lines of Sight Failures, page 16); and communications during the rally (see Lines of Communication Failures, page 19). Advance Planning Failures There was inadequate planning and coordination TASK FORCE before the rally on July 13, 2024. ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP There was no joint meeting between the Secret Service (USSS), state police, and local law enforcement (LLE) on the day of the rally. It remains unclear whether certain assignments were communicated by the USSS to LLE partners. USSS did not effectively verify responsibilities were understood and being executed. Over the course of twelve days—from July 2 through July 13- -the Secret Service's planning and coordination for the campaign event in Butler appears to have been inadequate. According to USSS Acting Director Rowe, “the Secret Service did not give clear guidance or direction to our local law enforcement partners."4 Documents and 1 The Ongoing Investigation of the Butler, Pennsylvania Security Failure: The Secret Service's Reliance on State and Local Law Enforcement: Hearing Before the H.

testimony obtained by the Task Force show that scattered meetings, vague instructions, and unclear chains of command caused confusion about the division of responsibilities— especially for local and state officers. On July 2, the former President's USSS detail (DTD) notified the USSS Pittsburgh field office of a potential campaign event on July 13.5 The USSS DTD confirmed the event date on July 3 and the USSS assigned a Lead Advance Agent the same day.6 The USSS DTD confirmed the event location on July 4.7 Secure Perimeter Did Not Include the AGR Complex TASK FORCE OF DONALD J. TRUMP THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION The AGR complex, and the surrounding area, were not part of the secure perimeter. Despite proximity to a main road, clear sight lines to the stage, and its elevated overlook, the Secret Service placed the AGR complex outside the secure perimeter for the event, and the AGR complex was not otherwise secured. 8 On July 8, USSS personnel, campaign staff, and Butler Farm Show staff walked the Butler Farm Show grounds. Evidence obtained by the Task Force shows that during the walkthrough, USSS personnel discussed with campaign staff how to implement line-of- sight mitigation from the area where the stage would be constructed.⁹ Acting USSS Director Rowe testified to a joint Senate Committee hearing: "Controlling high ground is something that's a must for us whenever we go into a location.”10 But the Secret Service designated the AGR complex, and the areas around the AGR complex, outside of the secure perimeter, despite its proximity to a main road and elevated positions from several areas on the property, including the rooftops. The USSS failed to ensure the risks associated with the AGR property were addressed, both in terms of lines of sight to the stage and as an attractive area for crowds to gather. 5 Production to Task Force, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bates 001367 (2024) (on file with the Task Force). 6 Id. 7 Id. 8 Id. 9 Production to Task Force, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bates 000794 (2024) (on file with the Task Force); Production to Task Force, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bates 001367-001368 (2024) (on file with the Task Force). 10 Examination of the Security Failures Leading to the Assassination Attempt on Former President Trump: Joint Hearing Before the S.

There is disagreement and confusion among the entities involved in planning for the July 13 event as to who was responsible for ensuring the AGR complex was secure. According to Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) Lieutenant John Herold, when the Secret Service assigned posts during a walkthrough at the Butler Farm Show property on July 11, the Secret Service did not request assets to be placed at the AGR complex, although PSP had the resources to do so." The PSP understood from the Secret Service that the Butler County Emergency Services Unit (Butler ESU) was responsible for the AGR complex.12 11 13 According to the Secret Service, however, Lieutenant Herold advised the USSS on July 9 that PSP had already spoken to the owner of the AGR property and "coordinated it to be closed, locked, and posted. The Task Force found that the AGR parking lot was in fact closed to vehicle traffic, but a crowd gathered on the adjacent grassy area near the chain link fence that marked the outer perimeter established by the Secret Service. Onlookers in that area did not need to pass through the event's magnetometers to see the rally stage despite being approximately 150 yards from where the former President was speaking. Drew Blasko, a patrolman with the Butler Township Police Department and an assistant team leader with the Butler ESU sniper team, testified to the Task Force that he shared his concerns about the AGR complex with the Secret Service on July 11. Patrolman Blasko testified that he told the Secret Service his team did not have the manpower to post officers around the AGR property, and that he asked the Secret Service for additional officers to be posted there. According to Patrolman Blasko, the Secret Service said, "they would take care of it." In response to questions from Rep. Madeleine Dean during the Task Force hearing on September 26, 2024, Patrolman Blasko testified: REP. DEAN: Is it true that within minutes of joining the walk through on the morning of the 11th, you shared your concerns about AGR complex not being secure? Again, here's the here's the rooftop where Crooks was positioned and dies. And shoots from and dies. You shared your concerns -- 11 John Herold, Penn.

BLASKO: REP. DEAN: BLASKO: REP. DEAN: BLASKO: REP. DEAN: BLASKO: about the AGR complex with whom, and what did you say? I did share my concerns with the agents, from my understanding, that were in charge of the site that day. I explained to them that the snipers inside that building were over watching the venue itself, and that the whole area, specifically the whole area leading up from the water tower, we had no vantage point from. We could see part of the building that was that Crooks was on, but we had no access or line of sight, I should say, to that area. And I asked the Secret Service members that we do not have the additional manpower to post anybody there. And I requested additional people to be posted there so there would be no access to those grounds. -- And what response did you get? That they would take care of it. They would take care of it? Yes. And did you think that meant they would put it within their secured perimeter? Whether they put it within their secured perimeter or they posted bodies, actual people there, that was my expectation of what was going to happen. 14 14 The Ongoing Investigation of the Butler, Pennsylvania Security Failure: The Secret Service's Reliance on State and Local Law Enforcement: Hearing Before the H.

Mismanaged Walkthrough On July 11, at 1000, the USSS led a walkthrough with PSP and local EMS, fire, and police at the Butler Farm Show. 15 The walkthrough covered the rally stage and crowd area, and the perimeter area along the fence that divides the Butler Farm Show property from the AGR property. Witnesses who participated in the walkthrough told the Task Force it was disorganized. 16 Butler ESU Commander Ed Lenz testified to the Task Force that "there was no structure to it. There was no, hey, let's all talk and figure out what we have to do. It was really just a bunch of people sort of milling around the site” and “it did not seem organized at all."17 According to Acting Director Rowe, USSS personnel "assum[ed]" that local police were going to adequately secure the AGR complex. 18 Rowe stated, “there clearly was not that follow up to make sure," and any deficiencies "were never escalated up to the supervisors to be able to resolve.”19 The evidence shows concerns about securing the AGR property were discussed during the July 11 walkthrough, but those concerns were not meaningfully addressed. 20 For instance, Butler ESU Witness 4 testified to the Task Force that, during the walkthrough, a Secret Service official “explained that there were to be uniformed officers in the area that day [but] that didn't take place." .”21 Butler Township Police Department (PD) Witness 1 similarly testified that the USSS did not provide any guidance as to whether or how to secure the AGR property, even after Butler Township PD Witness 1 advised PSP that his Department did not have enough manpower to station a car in the AGR parking lot during the rally.22 15 Production to Task Force, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bates 001368 (2024) (on file with the Task Force). 16 Butler ESU Witness 1, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

No Unified Briefing on July 13 On the morning of July 13. -the day of the rally-Butler ESU led a briefing at approximately 0915 with other tactical assets from across the region. 23 Officers from the Butler Township Police Department had a separate briefing at around 0930.24 The Secret Service did not participate in either briefing. Butler ESU Commander Lenz testified to the Task Force: "When I arrived the day of the rally, I actually did not speak to anybody from the Secret Service until I had to make a phone call to the Secret Service specific to a possible threat that the 911 center received."25 USSS held its own briefing at 1000 with USSS assets at the site. 26 USSS counter snipers and LLE sniper assets spoke with each other following these briefings, but witnesses testified to the Task Force that there was no broader briefing among USSS and local or state partners, nor were they aware of an intent to hold such a briefing. In fact, a PSP trooper who was assigned to the USSS Command Post for the rally was invited to the 1000 USSS briefing by one USSS agent, then subsequently asked to leave by another. 27 The lack of a unified briefing on July 13 may have led to gaps in awareness among state and local law enforcement partners as to who was stationed where, spheres of responsibility, and expectations regarding communications during the day. For instance, before the rally started, Butler County Sheriff's Office (CSO) Witness 1 expressed concern to Butler CSO Witness 3 about the fact that the AGR complex was outside the USSS secure perimeter, with no law enforcement on or near the building, to which Butler CSO Witness 3 responded that “PSP has that covered.”28 Butler CSO Witness 1 was unaware that personnel from the Butler and Beaver Emergency Services Units were inside an AGR Recorded Administrative Interview Before Penn.

building— Butler CSO Witness 1 could not see them from an assigned post near the AGR fence line. 29 Lines of Sight Failures The Task Force's investigation found that Crooks had a clear line of sight to the rally stage from his position on the AGR complex roof. At a Senate hearing on July 30, 2024, Acting Director Rowe stated that he visited the Butler Farm Show site and laid in the same position as the shooter “to evaluate his line of sight.”30 He testified: “What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.”³1 Local Tactical Team Positioning TASK FORCE EMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP Local sniper teams inside the AGR complex had a narrow field of vision and were not positioned to monitor the AGR property. The sniper teams in the AGR complex understood their assignment to be limited to overwatch of the rally site, rather than securing the AGR buildings, AGR roof or the areas around the AGR complex. Local law enforcement told the Task Force that the Secret Service did not give any guidance to Butler ESU and Beaver ESU regarding the placement, role, and responsibilities of their snipers on July 13, and that in the absence of any such guidance, they understood their assignment to be overwatch of the rally venue. 32 Edward Lenz, Commander for the Butler ESU, testified to the Task Force that he was never asked to put a sniper team on top of the roof of the AGR complex and that he never told USSS that he would. He testified to the Task Force that his team “didn't receive any direction from the Secret Service as far as 29 Butler CSO Witness 1, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

how they wanted our sniper teams to deploy or what their actual mission would be. So, our snipers, on our normal missions, they deploy more as marksman observers."33 In response to questions by Rep. Mike Waltz, Commander Lenz testified that USSS did not provide written guidance to the local sniper teams as to how to place their assets, and former USSS Agent Patrick Sullivan stated that USSS should “absolutely" have provided such guidance to their local law enforcement partners. They testified: REP. WALTZ: LENZ: REP. WALTZ: SULLIVAN: And you never got any written guidance of how many assets to put where? -- Correct. And and it was our decision to place those snipers in that the second floor of that AGR building. [Secret Service] were aware of that -- certainly aware that they would be there, but there was no feedback or guidance that they -- they wanted them there or that they didn't want them there, but really by not raising an objection... Mr. Sullivan, should that guidance have been provided, in your experience? Absolutely. Absolutely, no question about it. 34. Absent guidance to the contrary, and consistent with their typical role as “marksman observers," local ESU snipers positioned themselves inside the AGR complex, near windows facing the Butler Farm Show property, to conduct overwatch of the rally stage and crowd. The overwatch posture placed ESU personnel several feet back from the windows, looking through scopes toward the rally stage and crowd-unable to easily see the unsecured areas on the AGR property, including most of the rooftops of the AGR complex and the areas directly below the windows.³ 35 33 The Ongoing Investigation of the Butler, Pennsylvania Security Failure: The Secret Service's Reliance on State and Local Law Enforcement: Hearing Before the H.

Task Force that he was not concerned that a threat could gain access to the roof because he had "the understanding that [...] it was covered and people would be around the building. 38 Lines of Communication Failures At the Task Force hearing on September 26, 2024, Ranking Member Jason Crow stated: "The communication between the Secret Service and local and state partners was disjointed and unclear.”³9 The evidence shows that gaps in the lines of communication between and among the agencies responsible for securing the rally were a major contributing factor to the failures that allowed Crooks to fire eight shots from the roof of an AGR complex. Leading up to the rally, information about Crooks began circulating by radio and text message between state and local law enforcement. Whether any of this information reached the former President's detail is unclear. Secret Service records show that information about a suspicious person-Crooks—at the AGR property did not reach the Secret Service command post until about 1751.40 By then, Crooks had been under scrutiny by the Secret Service's state and local partners for approximately 40 minutes. 38 Butler ESU Witness 1, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Separate Command Posts There was no unified command post to facilitate TASK FORCE communications between the Secret Service and its state ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP and local partners. There were two command posts on the day of the event. Though the Secret Service command post could have accommodated more people, key local law enforcement partners were in a separate trailer in a separate part of the vast Butler Farm Show property, and there was no dedicated radio link between law enforcement in the two posts. On July 13, there were two command posts instead of one. The Secret Service established a command post at the Butler Farm Show to function as a communications hub during the rally. The only local government representative in the USSS command post was from the Butler County Department of Emergency Services (Butler EMS)—that representative, Butler EMS Witness 1, was focused on reports related to medical events during the rally. Notably, local law enforcement was not represented in the Secret Service command post. According to testimony from Butler ESU Commander Lenz, the lines of communication for July 13 were not established in advance of the event.41 Meanwhile, representatives from local law enforcement partner agencies— including those whose personnel first observed and engaged Crooks at the AGR property― were in a separate trailer elsewhere on the property. There was no dedicated radio link between law enforcement in the two posts, and cell connectivity issues further undermined communication during the critical period when the threat posed by Crooks rapidly escalated. The USSS command post consisted of USSS personnel, one official from PSP, and Butler EMS Witness 1. Butler Township PD Witness 1 testified that the Butler Police Department was not invited to have a presence in the USSS command post. 42 The local command post included local law enforcement entities (Butler ESU, Butler Township, Butler County Sheriff, and Butler County EMS). The trailer was not 41 The Ongoing Investigation of the Butler, Pennsylvania Security Failure: The Secret Service's Reliance on State and Local Law Enforcement: Hearing Before the H.

We need to be able to talk to Secret Service."43 Former USSS Agent Patrick Sullivan testified to the Task Force that it was "very unusual” to have separate command posts during a visit. Sullivan stated: Normally, there will be an overall command post for the entire visit. Then each site will have what's called a security room, where radio traffic pertinent to that individual site is controlled. And the command post, the overall command post should be the state, local police, Secret Service, and other federal partners 43 Butler CSO Witness 1, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, 80 (Sept. 5, 2024) (on file with the Task Force). Page 21
that may be assisting. So, this is very unusual that the way it turned out here at this site. 44 Butler ESU Commander Lenz testified to the Task Force that a unified command post mitigates issues related to an influx of radio traffic. For the July 13 rally, as with similar events, the federal, state and local teams used different radio channels. With a unified command post, information shared on the respective channels flows into a communications hub, where it can be relayed as appropriate. Lenz stated: It's not feasible to have everybody communicate on the same channel just because the amount of radio traffic. However, a unified Command Post, as we're all taught in many different FEMA classes, a unified Command Post solves that issue. 45 Butler EMS Witness 1 was stationed in the USSS command post. Butler EMS Witness 1 testified to the Task Force that he had not previously worked an assignment with multiple command posts. 46 According to Butler EMS Witness 1, whose duties that day were not related to law enforcement, USSS requested only one representative from local agencies in the USSS command post, and Butler EMS Witness 1 volunteered. 47 Critically, Butler EMS Witness 1 did not function as and said that he did not understand himself to be a liaison between—the USSS command post and the local command post. Butler EMS Witness 1 testified that he did not hear local law enforcement communications regarding a suspicious individual at any point during the July 13 event. 48 According to Butler EMS Witness 1, the command post had approximately thirty chairs, but only six people were at fixed positions in the room that day.49 Butler County Sheriff's Office (CSO) Witness 4 was stationed in the local command post and assigned to monitor the Butler CSO channel on the radio.

13.50 Butler CSO Witness 4 testified that he had trouble hearing anything besides his radio channel because of the sound of the air conditioning in the trailer, and he stated that physical dividers that separated him from others in the trailer interfered with his ability to overhear voices and radio chatter. 51 If he picked up information from the CSO channel that needed to be shared with USSS, Butler CSO Witness 4 said that he would have had to speak with the EMS representative in the local trailer who would relay it to Butler EMS Witness 1 in the USSS command post, who could then relay the information to USSS.52 Connectivity, Capacity, and Interoperability Issues In testimony to the Senate on July 30, 2024, Acting Director Rowe stated that a lack of communications capacity and radio interoperability challenges allowed Crooks to evade Secret Service detection. Acting Director Rowe stated that the Secret Service's internal review of the assassination attempt found an over-reliance on cell phones, instead of Secret Service radio frequencies, to communicate vital information. Local law enforcement officers, who searched for Crooks as his behavior on the AGR property became increasingly suspicious before the rally, shared information “via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion” instead of through the Secret Service's own network. Rowe stated: "The failure of personnel to broadcast via radio the description of the assailant, or vital information received from local law enforcement regarding a suspicious individual on the roof of the AGR complex, to all federal personnel at the Butler site inhibited the collective awareness of all Secret Service personnel.”53 The Task Force similarly found that the use of non-interoperable radios exacerbated the absence of a unified command post that would have functioned as a central hub for all radio communications. PSP, which served as a point of contact for several of the local agencies that supported the Secret Service on July 13, used its own set of radio channels, and there was no interoperability between the radios used by USSS, PSP, and the supporting agencies such as Butler ESU, Beaver ESU, and Washington SWAT.5 54 50 Butler CSO Witness 4, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Butler ESU officers attempted to address interoperability issues with Beaver ESU and Washington SWAT by offering them Butler ESU radios. Beaver ESU and Washington SWAT retrieved these radios. 55 Further, representatives from local law enforcement communicated in-person at the local command post.56 Butler ESU addressed interoperability with PSP by receiving a radio from PSP. However, the PSP radio did not work well for reasons attributed to connectivity issues. 57 Butler ESU Commander Lenz testified to the Task Force that “the radio reception for the State Police system was very poor." 9958 Butler ESU also attempted to address the lack of interoperability with USSS radios by offering Butler ESU radios to Secret Service counter snipers. USSS counter snipers, however, reportedly did not retrieve these radios. Lenz testified to the Task Force: LENZ: TF STAFF: LENZ: TF STAFF: LENZ: So I had communicated with [USSS Agent 1]. He was going to stop and pick up a ESU radio from our command post. And then also on the day of the rally, when [USSS Agent 1] arrived, he did a face-to-face meeting with our sniper team leader, [Butler ESU Witness 6], and he reminded him, hey, stop at the command trailer and grab one of our radios. Okay. So I listed him as having a radio as I assumed he was going to pick up a radio and be able to talk to us. Did he ever pick up that radio? He did not. 55 See, e.g., Beaver ESU Witness 3, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Notably, there were several Secret Service agents paired with local and state law enforcement throughout the rally which may have mitigated radio interoperability issues to some degree. Page 24
Timeline of Crooks' Movements TASK FORCE ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP Critical pieces of information about Crooks and the escalating threat situation at the AGR complex moved slowly due to fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command on July 13. Moments before Crooks fired, a local law enforcement officer radioed that Crooks was on the roof with a gun. There is no evidence, to date, that this information reached the former President's detail, and he remained on stage. The Task Force obtained information from the FBI and from witnesses affiliated with state and local law enforcement agencies that details Crooks' movements on July 13. The evidence shows the various aforementioned issues―ineffective advance planning, a poorly planned perimeter, and vulnerabilities related to lines of sight and lines of communication-allowed Crooks to move around the AGR property for several hours before climbing onto the roof and firing eight shots at the stage and crowd. Crooks Cases the Butler Farm Show On July 7, Crooks drove from his home in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania to the Butler Farm Show grounds, and was there for about 20 minutes.59 FBI investigators later assessed that Crooks was casing the area. On July 13, according to a receipt found in Crooks' pocket, he purchased a ladder from Home Depot in Bethel Park at approximately 930. He then drove to the rally site and arrived around 1000. He stayed about 70 minutes, then left the site. He drove back to Bethel Park. According to the FBI, at approximately 1330, Crooks' father gave him the firearm that would later be used in the assassination attempt. 60 The firearm was legally transferred to Crooks by his father the year prior. 61 Crooks told his father that he was going to a local 59 Briefing from Fed.

gun range, as he had done many times previously. 62 Crooks then bought 50 rounds of ammunition at Allegheny Arms & Gun Works at approximately 1354.63 Crooks Returns to the Property and Deploys a Drone Crooks returned to Butler and arrived at the Butler Farm Show property at about 1545.64 At approximately 1550, Crooks flew a drone over the site for 11 minutes. 65 The drone's flight path would have positioned the drone's cameras to show Crooks a view of the stage and podium approximately 200 yards away. Members of local law enforcement place Crooks in the vicinity of the AGR complex at or around 1626, but digital evidence subsequently showed Crooks was in fact near the Farm Show air strip at that time, walking past a row of vendors outside the secure perimeter approximately a half mile away from the AGR property.66 Law Enforcement Notices Crooks Three local law enforcement officers first noticed Crooks at approximately 1700. These observations were made independently, and based upon each officer's experience, Crooks's behavior and manner were suspicious. For instance, Butler ESU Witness 3, a member of the Butler ESU Quick Response Force (QRF), saw Crooks in the 1630-1700 timeframe. Butler ESU Witness 3 was stationed inside the secure perimeter near the barns behind the stage, but he was able to see Crooks as Butler ESU Witness 3 looked out toward the AGR property. Butler ESU Witness 3 stated: When I first observed him, he was seated on coincidentally the concrete wall that he was photographed to be sitting on. He came and went from that position multiple times. I - lack of a better term is I identified this person as not paying attention to the venue, not paying attention to anyone around him. He was secluded off to himself where the crowds they were - anybody else that was there was either trying to seek shade, they had 62 Press Release, Investigative Updates on the Butler, Pennsylvania, Assassination Attempt, Fed.

maybe a lawn chair with them, they are dressed in a way that would basically signify some form of participation in the rally. A lot of them were up against the outer perimeter fence line. And, again, one of these isolated individuals was drawn way back to the corner of the AGR building, secluded, playing on the phone. 67 Butler ESU Witness 3 also observed Crooks looking at the sniper teams that were positioned inside the AGR complex. Butler ESU Witness 3 testified: I observed that [Crooks] was looking up at my sniper elements, or what I believed he believed was our sniper elements, because there was open windows -- well, as much as they could open and then, again, would kind of come and go. And it really appeared to me that he had absolutely zero interest in anything that was happening inside the fence. 68 - 67 Butler ESU Witness 3, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Sniper 3 Image created by Beaver ESU Butler ESU Witness 4, a sniper from Butler ESU stationed inside the AGR complex, similarly observed Crooks behaving suspiciously slightly prior to 1700. Butler ESU Witness 4 testified to the Task Force: What I observed Crooks doing was - to me he looked he stood out. He was walking around the grassy area between AGR and the secondary fence line, kept looking up, looking at the building. One point that is what raised my suspicion is he was looking directly at the window I was positioned at. 70 ... He, like I said, he looked up at the window I was positioned at and kept looking at it. He walked directly towards the window and underneath of it up against the building to the point where I couldn't see him.

was somebody inside the building. And when he went up against the building to where I couldn't look down on him, I found that to be very suspicious. Butler ESU Witness 4 testified that he then lost sight of Crooks, and approached Beaver ESU Witness 3, a Beaver County Emergency Services Unit sniper also in the AGR complex, to ask if he had seen someone matching that description. Butler ESU Witness 4 stated: So what had happened was I had observed him. When he disappeared along the lower edge of the building, I couldn't see where he went any further. I walked over and spoke to [Beaver ESU Witness 3], and I asked him if he had seen this individual. And I described him with the long hair, gray T shirt, khaki shorts. At that time [Beaver ESU Witness 3] had not observed him.71 Finally, Beaver ESU Witness 3 stated that he first saw Crooks slightly after 1700. Beaver ESU Witness 3 testified: So I was kind of moving around the building a little bit on binocular glass and doing the observation, and I had moved from the room that I was in into the hallway and was standing where [Beaver ESU Witness 1] was positioned prior [to his departure from the site at 1619]. As I was just looking out at the crowd, I noticed an individual that was walking pretty close to the building, kind of looking up and down the building, and just thought it was odd. 72 Beaver ESU Witness 3 stated that he then lost sight of Crooks, but that Butler ESU Witness 4 saw him shortly thereafter and alerted Beaver ESU Witness 3. Beaver ESU Witness 3 confirmed with Butler ESU Witness 4 that they had seen the same individual by comparing Crooks's clothing and hair, and they both began to search for Crooks. 71 Id. at 34. 72 Beaver ESU Witness 3, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Law Enforcement Photographs Crooks and Sees Rangefinder Soon thereafter, Beaver ESU Witness 3 saw Crooks again and took two photographs of him. Beaver ESU Witness 3 (ESU 3, below) testified about the sequence of events: ESU 3: TF STAFF: ESU 3: And as I brought my binoculars down, I just happened to look down and I was like, 'There he is.' He was sitting directly below me. This is from the southwestern corner of that second building? Yes. And there is, like, a little wall that's about two and a half, three feet high, and he was just sitting on it. I'm like, 'Well, there he is.' So I don't know why. Maybe the opportunity and because he was so close. I'm like, I got my phone. I just pulled out the picture. The first one is the one of his back. That was the first picture that I took. And then the second picture is the because I took the first one. I'm like, 'Come on, man. Turn your head. Turn your head.' And then, finally, he turned, and then I took that second one, which was the side view.73 one Similarly, Butler ESU Witness 4 testified that Beaver ESU Witness 3 showed him the photographs of Crooks, and Butler ESU Witness 4 identified him as the person he had seen looking at the building. Butler ESU Witness 4 stated: A short time [after Butler ESU Witness 4 first saw Crooks] [Beaver ESU Witness 3] tells me that he does see the individual I described. So I walk back over to [Beaver ESU Witness 3], and at that point [Beaver ESU Witness 3] had showed me – he had taken two photographs of Crooks. I identified him as that was the individual I was describing earlier. At that time he was sitting on the concrete wall at the southwestern edge of the AGR complex that we were in scrolling through his phone." 74 73 Beaver ESU Witness 3, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Butler ESU Witness 4 returned to his post, and at approximately 1710, Beaver ESU Witness 3 yelled, “[Butler ESU Witness 4], he's out here again. He has a rangefinder.”75 Butler ESU Witness 4 stated that he encouraged Beaver ESU Witness 3 to notify local law enforcement leadership, but it is not clear that either did so, although Butler ESU Witness 4 did send a series of text messages to Butler ESU Witness 3 at 1715 that included a description of Crooks. The final message stated: “He has a range finder." Butler ESU Witness 3 stated that he did not see those text messages until approximately 1740.77 9576 Sat, Jul 13 at 17:15 Are you watching this guy up against our building? Long hair gray tshirt white shorts He has a range finder + iMessage Beaver ESU Witness 3 testified that he used his binoculars to observe Crooks and saw him use a rangefinder. He stated: 75 I noticed he was on a cellphone, and I was sitting there with binoculars. So I zoom in on his cellphone, and I could tell that he's looking at news feeds. Which particular ones, I don't know, but he he's scrolling through news feeds on his phone. So then he takes his phone and he puts it in his pocket, and he pulls out -- it's a rangefinder, but he pulls out a rangefinder and 5 Id. at 36. In his interview with the Task Force, Beaver ESU Witness 3 seemed to recall first seeing the rangefinder several minutes later, perhaps after 5:30, but contemporaneous messages in possession of the Task Force that are described in this report indicate that the rangefinder was known to Butler ESU Witness 4 no later than 5:15 PM, suggesting that Beaver ESU Witness 3 had likely informed Butler ESU Witness 4 of the rangefinder by that time. 76 Id. at 61; Text messages received by Butler ESU Witness 4, sent by Beaver ESU Witness 3, on July 13 at 1715 (on file with the Task Force). 77 Butler ESU Witness 3, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

he starts looking. At first, I'm like -- I'm looking -- I'm like, is this a rangefinder, or is that binoculars? So I grabbed my binoculars and I zoomed in again, and I noticed -- I'm like that's a rangefinder. So, you know, when I noticed him looking through this rangefinder he was looking towards the stage and kind of just in different areas, general areas, looking out but in the direction of the stage. I was like, yeah, this is not right. 78 Beaver ESU Witness 3 subsequently went to look for Crooks, moving around the AGR second floor. Beaver ESU Witness 3 observed a bicycle and a backpack that seemed suspicious, although the FBI subsequently confirmed those items did not belong to Crooks. 79 Beaver ESU Witness 3 stated that he photographed the bicycle and backpack at approximately 1725. He testified: So I went over there and was still looking around for this individual, and I had noticed over across the property there was a bike sitting there with a backpack and it was underneath the tree. And just from moving around earlier in the day, I didn't remember seeing that. So after seeing him and then after seeing that, it was like, eh. I thought it was kind of strange, so I took a picture of. 80 78 Beaver ESU Witness 3, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

During this period, Butler ESU Witness 3 had been conducting surveillance outside the AGR complex with binoculars. Butler ESU Witness 3 observed Crooks moving in and out of sight near the edges of the AGR complex. Butler ESU Witness 3 (ESU 3, below) testified to the Task Force: TF STAFF: ESU 3: TF STAFF: ESU 3: TF STAFF: ESU 3: Now, you said you occasionally lose sight of him, he looked like he was going around the building and then he would come back. At some point you you did see the text messages with the photos that were sent by [Butler ESU Witness 4]; right? Yeah. Prior to that, I received three text messages from [Butler ESU Witness 4] inside the building, and because he's we had a kind of a text back -- and forth where he was kind of observing that I was watching that area- Right. -- with a set of binoculars - Right. -- so these text messages returned and pretty much were saying, ‘Are you watching this guy Page 33
TF STAFF: ESU 3: up against our building? Long hair, gray T-shirt, white shorts. He has a rangefinder.' Right. So, obviously, as soon as I seen that series of messages, I presume or know exactly who he is referring to.81 Butler ESU Witness 4 testified that he continued to search for Crooks from 1715 to approximately 1740. At approximately 1739, Butler ESU Witness 4 received a call from Butler ESU Witness 3 in response to the text messages from Butler ESU Witness 4.82 Following this call, Butler ESU Witness 4 and Beaver ESU Witness 3 decided to report their observations of Crooks to law enforcement leadership. Secret Service, State, and Local Law Enforcement are Alerted At 1738, Beaver ESU Witness 3 sent a text message along with the photographs of Crooks to a group of local snipers. The message stated: “Kid learning [sic] around building we are in. AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a rangefinder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.

Kid learning around building we are in. AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him. Also a bike with backpack sitting next to it in rear of building that was not seen earlier. 5:38 PM 5:38PM 5:38PM Over the course of approximately 13 minutes, from 1738 to 1751, a series of calls and messages about Crooks's description and movements reached the Secret Service. At 1738, Patrolman Blasko received the text message from Beaver ESU Witness 3 with the photos of Crooks. Patrolman Blasko subsequently shared information about the suspicious individual with the Secret Service Agent stationed at his post. At 1742, Butler ESU Witness 6 phoned a description of Crooks to Butler ESU Commander Lenz in the local command post. Butler ESU Witness 6 gave Crooks's description, described his use of a rangefinder, and advised he was located near AGR at that time. 84 At 1744, Commander Lenz called PSP Witness 3, who was in the USSS Command Post, to relay this information.85 PSP Witness 3 stated that he verbally 84 H.

the communicated this information to USSS agents in the USSS Command Post while still on phone with Lenz. 86 Lenz also stated that he heard PSP Witness 3 immediately relay this information to others in the USSS Command Post during their phone call. 87 At 1745, Butler ESU Witness 6 raised his profile to the attention of the Secret Service counter snipers via a text message to a USSS Counter Sniper Team Leader, USSS Agent 1.88 989 At 1745, Commander Lenz stated on the OPS-4 radio channel-used by the ESU sniper teams that “PSP and Sheriffs should be en route,' although the extent to which officers from those entities deployed at that time is unclear. At 1747, he received the photographs of Crooks and forwarded them to PSP Witness 3; due to issues with cell service, they did not immediately go through.90 PSP Witness 3 eventually received the photographs of Crooks, and forwarded them at 1751 to a USSS Agent in the USSS Command Post.⁹ 91 Butler Township Police Department personnel may not have been present in the local command post at that time, which may have impacted their awareness of this information.⁹ There is also currently no evidence to suggest this information was relayed to the USSS DTD agents near the stage, or to the USSS Agents in charge of rally security. At the Task Force hearing, former USSS Agent Patrick Sullivan testified that: What should have happened, in my opinion, is when the suspicious person was identified, the detail leader and the shift agent should have been told there's an issue we're working, a suspicious person. And then at that point, it was probably -- probably would be inappropriate to remove the President from the stage. But the detail leader should know there's an issue. I may have to react quicker.

suspicious person, the detail leader and the shift agent should be told there's an issue. 93 Shortly after the photos of Crooks circulated on the text message chain, Beaver ESU Witness 3 observed Crooks again, but there did not appear to be any law enforcement personnel searching for Crooks in or around the AGR complex. Beaver ESU Witness 3 saw Crooks had returned to the picnic table with a backpack near him on the ground. Crooks soon "took off running.” Beaver ESU Witness 3 "yell[ed] across the second floor to [Butler ESU Witness 4] that now Crooks is at a picnic table with a backpack.”94 Beaver ESU Witness 3 (ESU 3, below) testified to the Task Force: TF STAFF: ESU 3: TF STAFF: ESU 3: So now we're at 6:00. You reported this in. At this point have you seen any kind of law enforcement on foot outside the building looking for this guy? No. When do you first see people start looking for this guy? So at about 6:06, 6:07-ish, as I was moving around the building that I was in, I seen Crooks. *** ESU 3: TF STAFF: ESU 3: And when I looked out, I noticed that Crooks was standing out beside that picnic table and there was a backpack sitting on the ground. Okay? When I looked, I seen him. He grabbed that backpack, and then he took off running. 95 93 The Ongoing Investigation of the Butler, Pennsylvania Security Failure: The Secret Service's Reliance on State and Local Law Enforcement: Hearing Before the H.

*** TF STAFF: ESU 3: TF STAFF: ESU 3: So you saw him at the picnic table, and you saw him run with the backpack? Yes. But then when he turned the corner, you couldn't see him any longer? Yeah. Once he went in between the buildings, I could not see him anymore. And at that point I had then radioed to communication command. I said, Hey, suspect spotted rear of building. Grabbed the backpack and ran in between the buildings.96 Officers Respond to Search for Crooks Butler Township Police Department (PD) personnel in the vicinity of the AGR complex responded to calls over the radio that described the escalating situation related to Crooks' behavior and movements. Butler Township PD Witness 2 testified to the Task Force that several officers in the area left their posts to look for Crooks. He stated: At that point there was another radio transmission. They were looking for him at the AGR building. [Butler Township PD] departed. He was in a patrol unit, in a patrol vehicle. He left and drove towards the AGR building, which would have been northwest of my location, and I started walking in the area where I was posted. Then another radio transmission came that they last seen him walking towards Sheetz by the AGR building, which would have been towards where my location was. So at that point I started between my intersection to southwest, say, there's a tree line. So I started searching that area. 97 96 Id. 97 Butler Township PD Witness 2, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Crooks Moves to AGR Roof Video obtained from a local business showed Crooks climbed to the roof via A/C units on the backside of the building in the AGR complex at approximately 1805.98 Video from a local business, police dash cam footage, and police body camera footage show Crooks's movement across multiple AGR complex roofs between 1805 and 1808.99 Bystanders also saw Crooks pulling himself up to the roof and taking position. 100 Several called the police, while others attempted to get the attention of police on the ground. In response to reports over the radio of a suspicious person, Butler Township PD Witness 2 left his post and approached the AGR complex. As he neared it, Butler Township PD Witness 2 observed Crooks on the roof of the AGR complex from Butler Township PD Witness 2's position near the tree line, which was at least 100 yards from the buildings. Upon seeing Crooks, Butler Township PD Witness 2 continued to move towards the AGR complex, but he lost sight of Crooks. Butler Township PD Witness 2 testified to the Task Force that he did not see any USSS personnel near the AGR complex at this point. Butler Township PD Witness 2 radioed the information—that “someone's on the roof”—to all officers in the area. Butler Township PD Witness 2 (PD 2, below) testified to the Task Force: TF STAFF: PD 2: TF STAFF: Okay, sir. When you approached the AGR building, did you see anyone on the roof? I did. [I]t is our understanding, [Butler Township PD Witness 2], that at 6:08 p.m., you [. . .] radioed that somebody was on the roof and that there was someone on the roof with white shorts. Do you recall making this transmission? I do, yes.

TF STAFF: PD 2: TF STAFF: PD 2: TF STAFF: PD 2: And where were you when you made this transmission? I would have been in the power line, walking up the tree line. A good hundred plus yards away from the building. And did the person that you saw on the roof match the description of the suspicious individual that had been ID'd over the radio moments prior? Yes. When you saw someone on the roof, sir, what did you then do? I made a radio transmission that the male was on the roof. Someone's on the roof. 101 From his location in a patrol car in the AGR complex parking lot, Butler Township Police Department (PD) Witness 4 heard the call from Butler Township PD Witness 2 over the radio. Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 told the Task Force that he was posted on the road near the AGR complex for traffic control. There was no traffic at his post, so Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 departed the post to assist with locating the suspicious individual when he heard about it over the radio. Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 arrived in his patrol car and parked at the water tower near the AGR complex, next to a PSP officer. Concurrently, at 1809, Commander Lenz called PSP Witness 3 in the USSS Command Post to update him that a suspicious person was now on the roof of the AGR complex. 102 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 was discussing the report of a suspicious male with the PSP officer parked next to him when he spotted Crooks moving across the AGR roofs. He testified to the Task Force that he saw a "male [who] appeared to have a gray shirt 101 Butler Township PD Witness 2, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

or a light shirt on running from the north end of the building to the south end of the building towards the fence of the outer perimeter of the rally."103 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 did not see a weapon. He testified to the Task Force: I'm watching this male go across the roof. At no point did I see a firearm or see him armed, to be honest. I just thought getting up there, I was going to run into a civilian that was trying to get away. And at no point did anybody else there yell out firearm or make it clear to me that, you know, he was armed before getting up 104 there.10 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 lost sight of Crooks when a tree blocked his line of sight to the roof. Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 testified to the Task Force: So the trooper and I arrive at the southeast corner of the AGR building. And as I was coming as I was approaching the AGR building, I could still see the male running and there was, I want to say, a tree or a bush, but it's a pretty large tree that covers above the roof, and that's where I lost sight of him. 105 Prior to Butler Township PD Witness 2's transmission that Crooks was on the AGR roof, Butler Township PD Witness 5 checked with Blasko in-person and learned about the suspicious person. 106 Butler Township PD Witness 5 was patrolling the area as part of his regular duties—he was not specifically assigned to work the rally. Butler Township PD Witness 5 then searched the water tower area and returned to Blasko. 107 At the time, Blasko was standing next to a USSS agent. 108 Butler Township PD Witness 5 told the Task Force that the USSS agent said, "if you find him, we'll talk to him."109 Butler Township PD Witness 5 proceeded to search around the AGR property, when he heard Butler Township PD Witness 2's transmission.110 103 Butler Township PD Witness 4, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

111 Meanwhile, Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 had decided to pursue Crooks on the AGR roof and exited his patrol car. As he moved towards the AGR complex, he encountered Butler Township PD Witness 5, who helped raise Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 onto the roof. 112 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 testified to the Task Force: From there, I was able to pull my hands to my chest. And as I began to try to, how I describe it is, like, getting out of a pool with your hands, like pushing up, my head is coming up, and luckily for me, I'm looking left as that happens. And that is when I first view Crooks on the rooftop. I see Crooks facing downrange towards the stage, but his eyes are back at me as I'm coming up. And I would say, like, his facial expressions was surprised. His eyes were very big, like, what are you doing up here?113 Law Enforcement Sees Crooks is Armed Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 saw Crooks's weapon for the first time when Crooks turned and pointed the rifle at him. Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 testified to the Task Force that he also saw that Crooks had a bookbag and extra magazines of ammunition for a long gun. When Crooks turned to aim his rifle at Butler Township Police PD Witness 4, Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 fell to the ground and immediately radioed that the suspicious person on the roof was armed. Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 stated: And from there, he just slowly turned on his waist, like-- he was proned out like this, and he kind of slowly turned around. And as I came up, that's when he pointed his firearm in my face. And at that time, I could see, you know, he had a bookbag with him, I could see mags. I knew he had a long gun, like an AR platform. And as I'm coming up and he's got the gun pointed at me, I don't know if I reach for my gun, if I slip, but all I know from that point is I'm looking at him, and all my weight is on my, like, arms, my hands, and I don't have a grip. 111 Butler Township PD Witness 4, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

As you can tell by the video, it's just my fingertips. And I have no support from the bottom from [Butler Township PD Witness 5] anymore. The next thing I know is, I'm smack against the ground and fall. Yeah. And from there, I just start yelling out to the guys that are there, I yell on the radio right away. I start saying, you know, South end, He's got a long gun, Male on the roof. I just kept repeating, He's got a gun, He's got a long gun. I'm telling the guys that are around, like, He's right up there, guns up, eyes up, still screaming on the radio. 114 Butler Township Police Department (PD) Witness 5 similarly testified to the Task Force that Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 immediately began alerting that the person on the roof of the AGR complex was armed with an assault rifle. Butler Township PD Witness 5 stated: “I try to get him up to the roof. He's kind of on the side, however he is up there. He comes back down screaming, “THERE'S AN AR! AN AR! A GUY WITH AN AR!115 To date, the Task Force has not received any evidence to suggest that message reached the former President's USSS detail prior to shots fired. The fact that Crooks was armed was reported out via the local patrol radio channel, OPS-3, which was heard by Commander Lenz, who moved to deploy Butler ESU's QRF at that time.116 Civilians on the AGR property were becoming increasingly aware of Crooks at this point. Beaver ESU Witness 3 testified to the Task Force that he saw the crowd-which had gathered to watch the rally-turn away from the stage and face the AGR complex, after the former President had started his speech. Beaver ESU Witness 3 assumed the crowd had turned to watch law enforcement engage Crooks on the roof." 117 114 Id. 115 Butler Township PD Witness 5, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

While the exact order of shots remains unclear, testimony from local law enforcement states that they took a shot in Crooks' direction, which may have caused Crooks to stop firing. Butler ESU Witness 5 testified to the Task Force that he was the first law enforcement officer to return fire at Crooks.

Farm Show property, in the vicinity of the stage. 119 When he heard Crooks fire an initial volley of three shots, Butler ESU Witness 5 located Crooks on the roof of the AGR complex. 120 He fired a single shot from a standing position at Crooks, who was in a prone position on the roof. 121 Butler ESU Witness 5 told the Task Force that he believes his shot hit Crooks. 122 The evidence shows Crooks was struck by a single bullet (see Autopsy and Toxicology, page 48). On July 15, then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle announced that a USSS “counter sniper team neutraliz[ed] the shooter" "123 and there is no evidence to date to the contrary. 124 125 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4—after falling from the roof―ran to retrieve his rifle from his patrol car. Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 returned to the AGR complex moments after Crooks was neutralized and made his way onto the roof. Footage from Butler Township Police PD Witness 4's bodycam shows he and a USSS agent interacted briefly on the roof, where the USSS agent remarked that Secret Service counter snipers fired the shot that killed Crooks. 126 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 then helped clear the AGR complex after hearing reports of a second suspicious person inside the building. 127 Butler Township Police PD Witness 4 left for the hospital approximately 30 minutes after shots fired to attend to his leg injury, which he suffered falling from the roof. 128 119 Butler ESU Witness 5, Transcribed Interview Before the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J.

Ladder TASK FORCE ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP Crooks did not use a ladder to access the AGR roof. Crooks did purchase a ladder on July 13, but he subsequently abandoned that ladder in a wooded area in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The ladder viewed in the widely circulated photographs of the AGR complex was placed by local law enforcement to access the roof after the assassination attempt. Based on reports that Crooks had purchased a ladder, and photos that circulated after the shooting that showed a ladder against the AGR complex, a narrative emerged that Crooks used a ladder to climb onto the roof of the AGR complex. While Crooks did purchase a five-foot ladder at approximately 930 the morning of July 13, he abandoned that ladder in a wooded area adjacent to the parking lot of a permanently closed business in Bethel Park, approximately 50 miles away from the site of the rally. 129 Example of published image 130 The ladder viewed in widely circulated photographs was placed by local law enforcement personnel to access the roof and respond to the scene after shots were fired. 13 129 PSP Response to Comm. on Homeland Sec., Penn.

Autopsy and Toxicology Findings TASK FORCE ON THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of DONALD J. TRUMP The autopsy report indicates a single bullet killed Crooks. The report indicates a single entry wound on the upper left lip and a corresponding exit wound in the rear neck area. The wounds are consistent with a high velocity bullet from a distant range. There is no evidence of an entry wound from a second bullet. After rendering the scene safe, the FBI contacted the Butler County Coroner's Office, and the coroner subsequently removed the body from the scene and conducted a death investigation. 135 The Butler County Coroner's Office then deferred to the Allegheny County Office of the Medical Examiner to conduct the autopsy due to Allegheny County's more advanced facility and capabilities. 136 Once Allegheny County completed the autopsy, the Butler County Coroner's Office consulted with the FBI, asking if there were any additional necessary investigative steps with respect to the body. 137 The autopsy was observed by FBI and PSP personnel. 138 Once the autopsy was completed, the Butler County Coroner's office consulted with the FBI to determine if there were any additional evidentiary needs with respect to the body. The FBI determined there were not, and the FBI and PSP concurred with the Butler County Coroner's Office decision to release the remains to the subject's family. 139 The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office subsequently prepared autopsy and toxicology reports. 140 The Task Force obtained the reports, which show Crooks was pronounced deceased at 1825 on July 13, 2024, as a result of a single gunshot wound to 135 FBI Update 8.28.24, Fed.

141 the head. The toxicology report revealed negative results for alcohol and drugs of abuse. 142 The bloodwork was positive for antimony, selenium, and lead. 143 The Allegheny County Chief Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy stated that the presence of lead could possibly be a result of the time Crooks spent at the firing range. 144 147 The The reports further describe a single entry wound on the upper left lip and a corresponding exit wound in the right lateral neck. 145 The bullet track is reported as a downward, backward, and rightward direction. 146 The report also describes re-entry and re- exit wounds from fragments at the upper right back attributable to the same bullet. wounds are consistent with a high velocity bullet from a distant range. 148 A small copper- colored metal bullet jacket fragment was recovered from the upper right back during the autopsy. The FBI has possession of the fragment. 150 The autopsy found no evidence of an entry wound from a second bullet. 149 151 The FBI released the crime scene at the Butler Farm Show grounds, and the AGR complex, to the property owners on a rolling basis, after collecting any items of evidentiary value. 152 The FBI's process for releasing the AGR complex included cleaning the biological material from the AGR roof. The FBI completed the final release of the scene on July 20-seven days after the attack. 141 FBI Update 8.28.24, Fed.

NEXT STEPS The Task Force will continue to rigorously investigate the July 13 assassination attempt in the coming months. The Task Force is in the process of conducting more than 20 transcribed interviews of federal officials and others who may have knowledge relevant to the events of July 13. The Task Force remains committed to uncovering the planning and security failures that led to the events of July 13, of which there appear to be many, and to examining potential legislative solutions to ensure the USSS is equipped to fulfill their "zero fail" mission. In addition, the Task Force received expanded jurisdiction through House Resolution 1470 to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Trump on September 15, 2024, at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. In furtherance of this investigation, the Task Force sent letters to the ATF, USSS, and FBI requesting documents, information, and interviews of relevant federal officials. This work will provide additional context and information on the impediments the USSS faces in safeguarding their protectees in this heightened threat environment and will inform the Task Force's overall conclusions.

APPENDIX I: SUMMARY OF RESOURCES State and Local Law Enforcement Entities The entities listed below were present on the day of the rally. While all entities are distinct and ultimately supported the U.S. Secret Service, certain entities were designated as leads for that day. Each state or local law enforcement entity was primarily responsible for supporting either security or logistics. Security entailed either tactical or patrol support. Logistics entailed either motorcade escort or traffic support. Several officers with Butler Township, though detailed to traffic, proactively assisted with patrol to help find Thomas Matthew Crooks when he was still a suspicious person at large. All counts are based on productions submitted to the Task Force. The exact count fluctuated throughout the day due to arrival and departure of those detailed for only part of the event or those responding to Butler Farm Show in the aftermath of the shooting. Lead: Butler Emergency Service Unit – Security (Tactical) Support: Beaver Emergency Services Unit Support: Washington Regional SWAT ✓ 44 individuals detailed between the three entities combined Lead: Pennsylvania State Police – Security (Patrol) and Logistics (Motorcade Escort) ✓ 32 individuals detailed Support: Butler County Sheriff's Office - Security (Patrol) Only ✓ 8 individuals detailed Support: Butler Township Police Department – Logistics (Traffic) ✓ 9 individuals detailed ✓ 1 individual fulfilling his full-time assignment to patrol his sector, which happened to include the rally that day Page 52
Emergency Services Entities Separate from state or local law enforcement, multiple entities collaborated to provide rapid medical response, primarily heat-related, at the rally. The exact number of personnel detailed to the rally is unknown but has been estimated to be about a dozen individuals, including emergency medical services providers, a Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner, and a registered nurse. The list of emergency services entities involved on July 13 includes but is not limited to the following: ✓ Butler County Emergency Services ✓ Butler Memorial Hospital ✓ Connoquenessing Valley Regional Emergency Management Agency ✓ Connoquenessing Volunteer Fire Company ✓ Prospect Borough Franklin Township Volunteer Fire Department Page 53

Opinion
Democrats Won the Ad War. Will It Be Enough?
With eight days to go until the election, Democrats face the very real possibility that they won’t win the presidency, Senate or House. But if the party does come up short, it won’t be for lack of trying — at least when it comes to advertising.
To figure out which party won this election’s ad war, Times Opinion dug into data on 3.7 million political ad airings on broadcast TV from Aug. 1 to Oct. 25. We combined those records, provided by AdImpact, with TV viewership estimates from Comscore to calculate how many households saw each ad.
The data is clear: Democrats dominated the airwaves.
Between August and late October, Democratic campaigns and PACs poured $213 million more into TV broadcast advertising than their Republican opponents. The extra spending secured Democrats a lead of 9.9 billion ad views nationwide.
In the presidential race, Kamala Harris outpaced Donald Trump, racking up 11.8 billion ad views to Mr. Trump’s 8.5 billion. Though her margins were small, Ms. Harris took the lead in ad viewership across five of the seven swing states. And she notched sizable victories in less competitive states, outspending Mr. Trump nine to one on nationwide ad buys.
Each campaign is most likely keeping an eye on the other’s spending to make sure they don’t fall too far behind in the election’s final stretch.
“It’s an arms race. If Harris buys 100 ads today in Philadelphia, Trump wants to counter that,” said Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist at U.C.L.A. “That’s why those poor people in Pennsylvania keep seeing more and more ads. You definitely don’t want to cede the endgame to your opponent.”
(Poor Pennsylvanians, indeed. Our analysis found that the state’s households have seen an average of 1,391 political ads since Aug. 1 — about 16 per day.)
Ms. Harris and her allies also outspent Mr. Trump six to one on radio ads and three to one on Google and Meta between early- and mid-October, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.
Looking at the nine most competitive Senate races, Republican candidates struggled. They had the ad advantage in just three races — Montana, Ohio and Pennsylvania — and by slim margins at that.
The Democrats’ biggest advantage was in Arizona, where households watched, on average, 160 more ads for the party’s candidate, Ruben Gallego, than they did for the Republican Kari Lake. Democrats were also competitive in Texas, where Senator Ted Cruz trailed the Democratic challenger Colin Allred by 92 ad views per household.
If Republicans win enough seats next week to gain a majority in the Senate, then there’s a good chance that Donald Trump will win too, given how many competitive Senate races are in swing states. That means the House could be the Democrats’ best chance at checking a Republican legislative agenda in 2025.
Erika Franklin Fowler, a political science professor at Wesleyan University and director of the Wesleyan Media Project, told me that advertising may be more effective for House candidates because they have a bigger opportunity to define themselves.
“Often, advertising is the only way that voters will hear about those candidates,” Fowler said.
That’s good news for Democrats, as they had the most ad views in all 25 House races that Cook Political Report rated as tossups.
According to a 2021 study by Vavreck, John Sides and Christopher Warshaw, House candidates who aired 100 more ads than their opponent added about 0.08 percentage points to their final vote margins. The same advertising lead gave Senate candidates a 0.04 to 0.06 point bump and presidential candidates just 0.02 points.
“We have fairly decent evidence that TV advertising has a very small but non-zero effect,” said David Broockman, a political scientist at Berkeley. “And when you multiply a very small effect by a gigantic amount of money, it could swing enough votes to change the outcome in a close election.”
The effectiveness of the Democrats’ advertising across House races may come down to one thing: how much voters care about abortion rights. Democratic ads about reproductive rights received more views than any other topic in 42 of the 99 congressional races in which the party advertised.
If abortion mobilizes Democratic voters the way it did in the 2022 midterms, Ms. Harris will also benefit. After taxation, reproductive rights were her and her allies’ top advertising priority. In the run-up to the election, her campaign continues to emphasize the issue.
While Ms. Harris has run a smattering of ads about taking on drug cartels at the border, Mr. Trump and down-ballot Republican candidates have made immigration their focus. They spent $415 million on ads that mentioned it to Democrats’ $104 million.
Many of the Republicans’ ads linked immigration and crime, blaming Ms. Harris and Democrats for a handful of grisly attacks committed by undocumented immigrants. (The ads ignore the fact that U.S. immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.)
It’s a battle-tested strategy for Republicans, who are riffing on the racist Willie Horton ad that helped George H.W. Bush win in 1988. Mr. Trump has campaigned as the law and order candidate before; one of his ads this year, featuring a woman whose son was tragically murdered by an undocumented immigrant, is largely a retread of a spot he ran in 2016.
According to the final Times/Siena national poll, immigration and abortion were tied as the most important issue to likely voters. If the former mobilizes more people to vote than the latter, Harris could be in trouble.
Advertising volume is important, but it doesn’t guarantee victory. Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 despite airing more than twice as many ads as Mr. Trump in the final nine weeks of the election. If the Republicans win next week, Democrats may need to rethink how they reach out to voters.

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/opinion/gender-education-gap.html:

You’ve probably heard a lot about the gender gap in presidential politics by now. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are two vastly different candidates, and that has made the gap so intense that this election has become a battle between the sexes. So what else is there to know?
A lot. And this most of all: In modern presidential politics, the gender gap has never been wider, but it gets particularly large when we break out gender by educational attainment.
According to a recent poll by Pew research, the gender gap is 17 points, with Mr. Trump ahead 8 points among men and Ms. Harris up 9 points among women.
The gap by education is 29 points, with Mr. Trump ahead 10 points among people without a college degree and Ms. Harris ahead 19 points among those with one.
But broken up by gender and education, we see that the gaps are driven particularly by men without a college degree and women with a college degree, with an overall difference of 43 points.
We are truly looking at two different Americas when we dig into the views of men without college degrees and women with college degrees. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum politically and experience essentially separate economies, and therefore give priority to distinct sets of character traits and issues.
Let’s take a closer look. Women with college degrees, who are generally more financially secure than other women, name abortion as one of the key issues deciding their vote, while both women and men without degrees tend to focus more on issues affecting their day-to-day finances or safety. While inflation affects everyone, it hits non-college-educated voters who feel they are falling behind hardest, especially now that the unemployment rate has been rising among those with less than a high school diploma.
Our research indicates that economic issues matter deeply to many men without a college degree, who respond strongly to populist messages aimed at acknowledging their anxiety, sense of loss and resentment.
These two groups also consume media in entirely different ways, which affects what they see and hear. Men — including those without college degrees — often spend time on X and Reddit, and many listen to podcasts and YouTube personalities concentrating on gaming, sports and politics. Women are more likely to frequent TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. Many seem more focused on content about personal growth, true crime and style.
With the contrasts in priorities and worldview between these two groups, it makes sense that they would have different voting patterns, and the presence of a woman on the Democratic ticket has only accentuated that. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center shows non-college-educated men choosing Mr. Trump at a rate of 55 percent to 39 percent; college-educated women are nearly the inverse, favoring Ms. Harris by 61 percent to 34 percent. The gap may be even bigger by Election Day; it could be the largest in history.
This isn’t a new trend. College-educated women have consistently voted for Democrats at high levels for years. But the divergence between non-college-educated men and college-educated women this year seems likely to surpass even its 2016 level.
Mr. Trump’s appeal to non-college-educated men is part of what’s driving this shift. Before 2016, the gap between college-educated women and non-college-educated men was not as broad. But while Joe Biden made inroads among non-college-educated men in 2020, gaining 5 percent more of their vote compared to Hillary Clinton’s share in 2016, current support for Ms. Harris among men without college degrees has dropped back down almost to Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 levels. This could certainly in part be due to gender biases; non-college-educated men tend to be less receptive to the idea of women in executive positions. A study found that men without college degrees are least confident that a woman has what it takes to run a major American company (78 percent are confident compared to 91 percent of college-educated women). Our research suggests that they worry whether women are strong enough, can be respected by foreign leaders and are able to boost manufacturing.
This campaign in particular shows that both parties have problems with key demographics. Years ago, Democrats could count on support from male union workers, but Mr. Trump is increasingly winning over those voters — not only because of his direct, emotional appeals to their anxiety and values, but also because Democrats have struggled to establish a compelling enough populist economic message or break into the media ecosystem that non-college-educated men consume.
Mr. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, seems to have an especially potent attraction for some of these working-class voters. “Increasingly, Republicans are the party of working- and middle-class people,” said Mr. Vance, whose family’s working-class background could be a powerful tool to bring in these non-college-educated men who turned to Mr. Biden in 2020, particularly white ones.
As for Ms. Harris, she is particularly appealing to educated women. Republicans used to be stronger than Democrats with college-educated women, but that started to change in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. Contemporaneous research indicated that educated women were more secular and more progressive on social issues than other voters at the time. They also supported government programs to provide a safety net and opportunity for all (sound familiar?). They opposed the Reagan tax cuts and deregulation and feared war. But many stuck with the Republican Party through the 2000s as part of the “security mom” coalition. We saw echoes of this in 2022 when Republican candidates in New York and elsewhere were able to leverage safety concerns to win over enough of these women to prevail on Election Day.
Ms. Harris has been able to use abortion rights to bring back some women with college degrees who might otherwise have stayed with the Republicans. She already had a record of defending reproductive rights, and this year, she visited swing states to speak about abortion. Even in the early days of her campaign, she focused on abortion rights, vowing to restore the rights that had been enshrined in Roe v. Wade and organizing events in battleground states devoted to the issue. Women with college degrees were already a core base for Ms. Harris and the Democratic Party, but these moves helped increase her support among women of all ages. She and her campaign know that she needs to register and turn out voters who favor abortion rights to offset the non-college-educated men Mr. Trump is poised to win.
While it might seem impossible for a candidate to appeal to both non-college-educated men and college-educated women, there are areas where policies and messaging could bridge the gap.
A populist message, for example, could win more men without college degrees without alienating college-educated women, as anti-corporate sentiment is common among voters across the political spectrum and can play into concerns about both economic issues and freedom from control. Either party could leverage this sentiment.
Both groups seem to want investments in public education and job skills training. Many in both groups are worried the next generation will not be as well off as the one before. Many want clean air and water and worry about pollution. Non-college-educated men tend to want to preserve natural areas for recreation like hunting, our data indicates, while college-educated women are particularly concerned about climate change. Both groups seek more respect and power, our research shows, and both see politics as a zero-sum game. The divide between these two groups seems unlikely to change before Election Day, but for either party to bridge the gap in the long term, it will need to work to appeal to both groups.
The story of this election could well be the gender gap between those Americans who went to college and those who didn’t. As the candidates consolidate support among their base, the divide between college-educated women and non-college-educated men seems almost impossible for Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump to overcome. The big question for America going forward is, can these two groups be brought together after a campaign that has only driven them further apart?

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/upshot/voters-moving-polarization.html:

Aside from their political views, Joshua Fisher and Ryan Troyer have a lot in common.
In 2020, they lived across the street from each other in Sioux Falls, S.D. They are both white men of a similar age. Mr. Fisher, 42, is an auto technician; Mr. Troyer, 39, is a sanitation worker. They are both married. They both have associate degrees.
They have something else in common, too: They both moved away from Sioux Falls. Mr. Troyer left in the fall of 2021, and Mr. Fisher about a year later.
In the process, they unwittingly became a part of a nationwide pattern that could matter in a close presidential election.
They made the country more geographically polarized.
These estimates, based on a New York Times analysis of detailed public voter registration records of more than 3.5 million Americans who moved since the last presidential election, offer a new and extraordinarily detailed glimpse into one of the ways that we segregate from each other — down to the street level.
Across all movers, Republicans chose neighborhoods Donald J. Trump won by an average of 19 percentage points in 2020, while Democrats chose neighborhoods President Biden won by the opposite margin (also 19 points). In total, movers started in neighborhoods 31 percentage points apart; they ended in neighborhoods 38 points apart. Across the country, the result is a widening gap between blue neighborhoods and red ones.
The independents and unaffiliated voters in our set picked more evenly balanced neighborhoods.
The different choices that movers made are not easily explained by things like voters’ ages, race, income or if they were leaving a rural or urban area. Even when narrowing our comparisons to demographically similar pairs of people from the same kinds of neighborhoods — people like Mr. Fisher and Mr. Troyer — Democrats and Republicans still chose neighborhoods that were 24 points apart in the 2020 vote.
Our analysis suggests partisanship itself, intentional or not, plays a powerful role when Americans uproot and find a new home. And their very personal decisions about where to resettle help power the churn of migration that is continuously reshaping American life at the neighborhood level and contributing to a sense that Americans are siloed in echo chambers, online and in their daily lives.
It also has real stakes for our elections: Political scientists say the more partisan a district or state becomes, the less a candidate needs to woo voters from the other party — or, after winning, govern on their behalf.
Interviews with 20 recent movers found that, consistent with research on the subject, politics alone did not drive a decision to move. But most we spoke to said it did influence their decision, and for some it topped the must-have list — the movers in our analysis are all registered to vote, and nearly all we spoke to intended to vote on Election Day.
Impact on the 2024 election
It’s unclear how much of a direct effect movers might have on the election next week. Each cycle, the electoral landscape changes in ways that have nothing to do with moving: People turn 18; people die; people change their minds or decide not to vote. But in an extraordinarily close race, even small shifts could prove decisive.
The 3.5 million movers in our analysis are a small number compared with the 158 million people who voted in 2020, but they do help explain some recent electoral trends — like Florida’s electoral shift to the right or the gains Democrats have made in Georgia.
In all but three states that voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, more Democrats have moved in than Republicans. The reverse is true for states Mr. Trump won — in all but one, more Republicans moved in.
In 36 states, polarization happened in both directions at once: More newcomers were of the winning party, and more of those who left were of the losing party.
Our analysis is an undercount of partisan migration; it may be missing some movers who haven’t yet filed a new address or registered to vote in their new homes. But it probably accounts for most voters who moved, and it shows how population shifts can have political consequences.
Consider Florida: Once a critical swing state, it has become more reliably Republican. Out of the 3.5 million voters we tracked, more than 200,000 registered Republicans have moved in over the past four years, more than twice the number of Democrats.
Mr. Biden won Georgia in 2020, the first time a Democrat won the state since 1992. Among more than 140,000 newcomers, Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than 9,000. Over the same span, at least 10,000 more Republicans than Democrats moved out of the state — a third of them to Florida.
In Arizona, a state Mr. Biden won by less than 12,000 votes, incoming Republicans — a third of them from California — outnumbered incoming Democrats by a margin of three to two. Accounting for departures, Arizona gained about 17,000 Republican voters.
In all three Northern battlegrounds — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — Democrats made small gains through migration. In Pennsylvania, this year’s key battleground, Democratic gains actually came amid population loss: For both parties, more voters moved out than in. But Republicans lost more.
California has contributed to this trend in a different way: by exporting Republicans en masse. More Republicans have moved out of California than any other state. And those who did have made other states redder in the process — particularly Texas, Arizona, Florida and Nevada.
What drives moving
Tens of millions of Americans move each year, whether across town or across the country. Most of the voters in our set moved during the pandemic, when home sales surged and many Americans were ready for a change.
Mr. Troyer, the Republican from Sioux Falls, moved closer to his wife’s family in Minnesota. Mr. Fisher, the Democrat, moved to escape the harsh South Dakota winters.
And yet both ended up in places that were more partisan than where they came from, a phenomenon known as “sorting.” Research on partisanship and migration has found politics typically figures into the equation only indirectly — or even coincidentally.
Previous research has found that most people don’t intentionally seek out politically homogenous areas, but instead share similar preferences with people who vote as they do, with Democrats favoring cities and Republicans favoring the country, on average. A 2015 study, however, found that people favor properties in neighborhoods that reflect their partisan identity.
“Am I going to fit? Fittingness is a very important criteria for a place to live,” said James Gimpel, a politics professor at the University of Maryland, and co-author of the study. “Nobody wakes up in the morning and says, ‘Gee, I’m looking forward to having a fight with my neighbors.’”
Our analysis and interviews suggest just how intertwined political and lifestyle choices can be when it comes to choosing a new home, particularly since 2020.
Mr. Fisher, the Democrat, said that while he was eager to escape the snow, he also found the local politics increasingly oppressive. An outspoken liberal, with bumper stickers on his Jeep to match, he was eager to find a place that better reflected his sensibilities.
“For the most part, you just kind of kept to yourself,” Mr. Fisher, a South Dakota native, said of his old neighborhood, a precinct Mr. Biden won by five points. He says he feels more comfortable in his home in southwest Charlotte, in a precinct Mr. Biden carried by 46 points. “It’s definitely bluer than where we were before, and kind of a nice change,” he said.
And Mr. Troyer now lives in Otsego, northwest of Minneapolis, which Mr. Trump won by 27 points. Mr. Troyer said he chose his neighborhood because it was close to his job and family. While he did not intentionally seek out a conservative community, he feels at ease at home and at work. “Everybody I associate with is Republican,” he said. “Everybody at work, the hardworking kind, we’re all Republican.”

Somewhere to belong
For a handful of the people interviewed for this article, politics was the impetus.
Erin Thompson, 39, felt out of step as the lone Republican voice among her Seattle friends. Even dating was hard. “You want to find someone who has the same fundamental belief system as you,” she said. Absent that, “It’s just a little isolating.” In 2021, in search of warmer weather and a community more closely matching her worldview, she moved to Gilbert, a conservative Phoenix suburb.
Romance was also a factor for Andrew Clohessey, 35, who moved to Minneapolis in 2021 from Cedar Falls, Iowa. He’d spent the previous year deliberately applying for jobs in liberal cities, eager to get out of an area that felt increasingly conservative to him, even though his precinct voted for Mr. Biden. He moved into a neighborhood with a lot of shops within walking distance, one that Mr. Biden carried by 61 points. “It’s been great,” he said. On dating apps he is now “more likely to match with people who have left-leaning political views.”
In contrast, Naomi Hattaway, 48, said politics “did not register one bit” when she moved for work to Fairburn, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, from Omaha (after a stop in Florida). An independent who previously registered as a Democrat, she said diversity mattered more to her than party affiliation. She feels more at home as a Black mixed race woman in a city with a large Black population and a diverse local government. “It’s everything,” she said, adding that she is “better off living somewhere I belonged.”
All movers we spoke to felt politically comfortable in their new homes. Upon retiring, Robert LaRoche, 60, moved from Las Vegas to Spring Hill, Fla., about an hour north of Tampa to live closer to family. While the majority of his old neighbors in a precinct that voted for Mr. Biden by 41 points “did not align with our values,” he said, that’s not why he moved, nor was it why he chose his new home. He sees it as a bonus that he gets to live in a precinct that voted for Mr. Trump in 2020 by 26 points.
Mr. LaRoche’s sentiment is shared by more and more Americans — that life is less contentious when the people around you vote the way you do.
“Now I can talk to my neighbors about absolutely anything and not start a big argument,” he said.

Republicans Shift Message on Abortion, Sounding More Like Democrats
Josh Riley, the Democratic challenger running for Congress in New York’s 19th District, has a clear message on abortion: “I believe that women’s health care decisions are women’s health care decisions and that politicians should stay the hell out of it.”
And his Republican opponent, the incumbent Representative Marc Molinaro, is saying nearly the same thing: “I believe health care decisions should be between a woman and her doctor, not Washington.”
Across the country’s most competitive House races, Republicans have spent months trying to redefine themselves on abortion, going so far as to borrow language that would not feel out of place at a rally of Vice President Kamala Harris. Many Republicans who until recently backed federal abortion restrictions are now saying the issue should be left to the states.
At least a half-dozen Republican candidates have put out direct-to-camera ads declaring their opposition to a federal abortion ban. Instead, they say, they support exceptions to existing state laws and back protections for reproductive health care, such as I.V.F.
Democrats have raised the possibility of a nationwide abortion ban should Republicans win in November, and they are framing the campaign as another referendum on the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade. They are hoping to continue their run of electoral successes since the 2022 decision to win back control of the House.
Any new federal legislation on abortion would have to pass both the House and the Senate and be signed by the president to become law. But whichever party emerges with a majority in the House will have the ability to dictate the legislative agenda, including whether measures to restrict or expand abortion access have the chance to pass.
Republicans in California and New York in particular, who are running in swing districts in blue states that favor abortion rights, have felt the most pressure to address the issue directly. “If we don’t talk about the issue, we become whatever the Democrats say we are,” said Will Reinert, the press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
To better understand how abortion is playing a role in these campaigns, The New York Times surveyed candidates from both parties in the most competitive House races about their support for federal limits on abortion. The Times also looked at voting records, issues listed on campaign websites, debate and media coverage, and endorsements from major abortion rights and anti-abortion groups.
The Times survey showed that while Republicans are notably focused on what they will not do on abortion at the federal level, their Democratic opponents are talking about what they will do to protect abortion rights. Nearly all the Democratic candidates said they supported restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade, which would allow access to abortion until fetal viability, or around 24 weeks, in every state.
In attack ads, Democrats are pointing to their opponents’ voting records or past statements as evidence of extremism — despite what they may be saying now.
More broadly, abortion rights groups said Republicans are misleading voters by claiming they do not support an outright abortion “ban,” when they might support a federal “limit” or “standard,” such as the 15-week proposal put forward by Senator Lindsey Graham in 2022.
“They are playing around with the semantics; they are clearly testing out different framing and messaging in an attempt to try and deceive voters because they realize how politically unpopular their policy stances are,” said Jessica Arons, a director of policy and government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union.
Republicans in the Times survey almost universally declined to answer questions about gestational limits. Only one, Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he supported a specific federal limit, in the third trimester.
The Republican shift away from publicly supporting a federal ban follows the lead of former President Donald J. Trump, who has changed his own language on the issue after seeing the electoral backlash to the Dobbs decision.
As recently as 2021, a majority of House Republicans — including seven incumbents in this year’s tossup races — co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, a bill that would have amounted to a nationwide abortion ban. This year, Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania’s 10th District was the only incumbent in a competitive race to stay on as a co-sponsor.
Two Republican incumbents who now say they oppose a national ban — Representatives Ken Calvert and David Valadao in California — voted in favor of a 20-week ban that passed the House in 2017. Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican, co-sponsored a 15-week ban on abortion in 2022. She did not respond to questions about whether she still supports it.
Other Republicans described themselves as personally “pro-life” but said they accepted the abortion laws in place in their states. Rob Bresnahan Jr., a challenger in Pennsylvania’s 8th District, said he supported the state’s current law, which allows abortion until 24 weeks.
Democrats, when they were not attacking Republicans, leaned into language about personal freedom, with many in the survey saying the government should not be involved in medical decisions.
Another common refrain was that the decision to have an abortion should be “between a woman and her doctor.” Two Democrats used similar language rather than explicitly calling for federal abortion protections.
By appearing to moderate their stance on abortion, candidates have risked losing the backing of prominent advocacy groups. Only three Republicans in the tossup races received an endorsement from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and seven received one from National Right to Life.
Two major abortion rights groups, by contrast, endorsed nearly all the Democratic candidates. Planned Parenthood — whose political action fund is pouring $40 million into the campaign — endorsed all but six candidates, while Reproductive Freedom for All endorsed all but four.

Representative Jared Golden, the Democratic incumbent in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District — an area Mr. Trump won by six points in 2020 — did not get Planned Parenthood’s endorsement this year. He said the reason was his vote for the 2024 defense policy bill, which included an amendment blocking reimbursement for abortion travel costs for service members.
Mr. Golden said he was not concerned about the lack of support from the group, pointing instead to his co-sponsorship of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill to restore the protections of Roe.
“I’m quite confident that voters in Maine know where I stand,” he said.

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/bayesian-yacht-sinking-italy.html:

The seas were calm when the Bayesian, the $40 million superyacht of the British tech mogul Michael Lynch, dropped anchor off Sicily.
It was a celebratory voyage. But before dawn, a storm blew in.
Lightning crackled. Winds neared hurricane strength. The sky dumped a blinding torrent. The yacht drifted out of control. Then it was gone.
A New York Times investigation discovered that the Bayesian’s most striking feature — its extra-tall mast and the engineering to accommodate it — made the yacht vulnerable to capsizing.
The Bayesian was an outlier. All the other boats in the same series, from the same Italian manufacturer, had two masts instead of one.
Technical documents obtained by The Times and computer models show the yacht was susceptible to being knocked over in a storm and would sink quickly.
Fifteen survivors, bloodied and broken, made it to a life raft. But seven died as the Bayesian plunged to the bottom, where divers have searched for answers.
What Sank the Tech Tycoon’s ‘Unsinkable’ Yacht?
It all happened so fast.
Karsten Borner was planted on the halfdeck of his sailboat in the slanting rain. A grizzled mariner who had survived many storms, he was anchored in the same cove as Mr. Lynch’s yacht, at the same time, as the squall blew in during the early hours of Aug. 19.
Luckily, he was already awake. As the wind picked up, he and his crew scurried around closing hatches, clearing the decks and firing up the engines to keep his boat steady.
He couldn’t see much, but in flashes of lightning, he kept catching glimpses of Mr. Lynch’s long, sleek sloop bobbing behind him. It was only a few hundred feet away and its super-tall aluminum mast — one of the tallest ever made — was lit up with bright white lights, swaying in the wind.
Then he lost sight of it. The rain fell like gravel, drawing a curtain around his boat. When he looked up again, he was stunned. The Bayesian was disappearing, at a very odd angle, into the sea.
In the weeks since, Mr. Borner, who has sailed for more than half a century, still can’t believe the yacht sank in front of him. There weren’t any big waves that night, he said. Both boats were close to shore. His own sailboat — a converted tugboat built in East Germany 66 years ago — weathered the same squall just fine. And that other craft was a superyacht of the superrich, gleaming blue, 184 feet long and drawing stares wherever it went.
“It’s a mystery,” Mr. Borner said.
That mystery has rippled around the globe as several investigations into the tragedy unfold. It has vexed maritime experts and compounded the grief of family and friends of the seven people who perished, including Mr. Lynch and his teenage daughter, Hannah, whose bodies were found trapped below deck.
The investigations turn on three central questions: Why did the Bayesian, which now lies 160 feet at the bottom of the Mediterranean, sink so fast? Did the yacht have any design flaws? Did the captain or crew make any fatal mistakes?
The Bayesian was a one-of-a-kind sailboat, built by Perini Navi, a famous Italian yacht maker. The company says the group of 10 superyachts that the Bayesian belonged to was “the most successful series of large sailing yachts ever conceived.”
But the Bayesian was different. Its original buyer — a Dutch businessman, not the Lynches — insisted on a single, striking mast that would be taller than just about any other mast in the world, according to the Italian yacht maker and three people with detailed knowledge of how this boat was built.
That decision resulted in major engineering consequences that ultimately left the boat significantly more vulnerable than many comparable superyachts, The Times investigation has found.
— More than a dozen naval architects, engineers and other experts consulted by The Times found glaring weaknesses in the Bayesian’s design that they said could have contributed to the disaster.
— Basic design choices, like the two tall doors on the side of the deck, increased the Bayesian’s chances of taking on dangerous amounts of water if high winds pushed the boat over toward its side, several naval architects said.
— Witness and survivor accounts revealed how this deadly sequence unfolded in real time: The yacht fell completely on its side and sank within minutes.
Seemingly small details on any boat — like how close air vents are to the waterline, or where a ship’s ballast is placed in the hull — might not sound decisive on their own. But when taken together, experts said, they appear to have compromised this vessel.
Such built-in vulnerabilities may not have been solely responsible for the yacht’s sinking, of course. The storm’s unexpected ferocity definitely played a part in the calamitous stew of events. Italian investigators are also looking hard at the actions of the Bayesian’s captain and crew.
Giovanni Costantino, the chief executive of the Italian Sea Group, the company that owns Perini Navi, said that when operated properly, the Bayesian was “unsinkable.” He maintains that the yacht was carefully engineered to survive bad storms, and he has put the blame for the tragedy squarely on the crew, accusing them of making a chain of fatal errors.
“I know, all the crew knows, that they did not do what they should have done,” he said. (Crew members have not revealed much, saying they are under a “gag order.”)
Mr. Costantino said the design was not at fault and that the towering mast, which stood 237 feet tall, had not created “any kind of problem.”
“The ship was an unsinkable ship,” he said. “I say it, I repeat it.”
The world of superyachts is incredibly opaque, the exclusive realm of some of the richest people on the planet, and exactly how these multimillion dollar boats are designed, approved and owned remain closely guarded secrets.
Making sure a superyacht is fit for the seas is a job left to a network of private companies and public agencies, and the Bayesian’s design was approved by the American Bureau of Shipping and the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency.
All the attention this tragedy has received could result in a closer look at yachting regulations. Several naval engineers in different countries who have gained access to the Bayesian’s documents say that as yachts have become more elaborate and subject to owners’ whims, others may be in danger as well.
The Bayesian’s technical documents show just how vulnerable it was. Even without major errors by the crew, the ship could have sunk in a storm that other boats survived, engineers say.
“We can look at it in hindsight and say they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. No, that’s not true,” said Tad Roberts, a Canadian naval architect who has nearly 40 years of experience designing boats, including superyachts.
“This boat had definite shortcomings that kind of uniquely made it vulnerable to what happened.”
The Victory Voyages
A cruise on the Bayesian was a voyage into luxury. The days were typically warm, sunny and calm, and finished off with plates of fresh langoustine and sumptuous chocolate. Hours would pass lounging on sun chairs, swimming in the sea or maybe taking out a kayak while the Bayesian crew, in branded polo shirts, watched vigilantly from the deck.
“It felt like a beautiful hotel that was floating on water,” remembers Abbie VanSickle, a New York Times reporter who was invited aboard in July because her husband, Jonathan Baum, was part of Mr. Lynch’s legal defense team.
Mr. Lynch had been acquitted in June in a criminal case in which he was accused of fraudulently inflating the value of his software company when he sold it to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion. He could have been sent to prison for years. To celebrate his win — and his freedom — he asked friends and lawyers to cruise the Mediterranean with him.
Mr. Lynch seemed proud that his boat had one of the world’s tallest masts — a little booklet in her cabin even said as much, Ms. VanSickle remembered. Whenever they chugged into a harbor, she said, “people would take photos of it constantly because it was so crazy-looking in comparison to other boats.”
Most of the time, though, the Bayesian operated like a motorboat, powered by two enormous diesel engines. During her five-day voyage, Ms. VanSickle said they sailed only once, for just a few hours. But when they did, the boat moved through the water so smoothly, she said, it felt like they were “gliding.”
A few weeks after Ms. VanSickle got off and returned to her life as a reporter in Washington, Mr. Lynch welcomed aboard his next batch of guests. This was the second celebratory voyage, beginning in mid-August, and Mr. Lynch had planned to get back to London, where he lived, around Aug. 20.
Among the 12 passengers were Mr. Lynch; his wife, Angela Bacares; their 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, who was soon off to Oxford; one of his lead lawyers, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, Neda Nassiri, who designed handcrafted jewelry; Jonathan Bloomer, an international banker and trusted adviser, and his wife, Judy, a psychotherapist celebrated for her charity work.
Mr. Lynch also invited some younger colleagues, including a couple who brought a baby on board. The crew was led by James Cutfield, an experienced New Zealand sailor, backed up by a first mate, a ship engineer, several deckhands and hostesses, totaling 10 in all.
Mr. Lynch was on the rebound, fired up about the possibility of starting a nonprofit to help exonerate people wrongly accused of crimes, said Sir David Davis, a friend and prominent conservative British politician.
Mr. Lynch sent Sir David a text message offering the choice of lunch or dinner in London on Aug. 22, when he was back.
An Unanticipated Storm
The Mediterranean Sea was flat on Aug. 18. But bad weather was moving south, from Naples toward Sicily. The Italian Air Force’s Meteomar forecast warned of scattered thunderstorms, gusts of wind and a rough sea. Several yacht captains said the weather warning was far from specific or extraordinary.
Mr. Borner, the captain who for decades has been running cruises and diving excursions on his old sailboat, the Sir Robert Baden Powell, was finishing up his own trip, picking his way west along the Sicilian coast.
The wind was blowing from the northwest and Mr. Borner figured that the curvature of Sicily’s rugged coastline at Porticello, a small fishing village built around a cove, would shelter him. He arrived in the cove that afternoon, went ashore with his guests and grabbed some pizza.
“It was a nice evening,” he remembered.
While they were in town, the Bayesian chugged into the same cove. It dropped anchor at 9:35 p.m., about a third of a mile from land. As Mr. Borner went to sleep around 11, the night was clear. The lights of the Bayesian’s mast glowed behind him.
At midnight on Aug. 19, the Italian Coast Guard put out a warning for a northwesterly Gale Force 8, a serious storm in which winds could reach 46 miles per hour. But the gale was predicted to hit hundreds of miles from Sicily.
Around 3 a.m., Mr. Borner woke up to help some of his passengers catch an early flight from Palermo, Sicily’s biggest city. But as the winds picked up rapidly, whipping the cove into a frothy chop, he scratched his plan to go ashore.
He and his crew shut the portholes and skylights and started the engine, to keep the bow pointed into the wind and prevent the boat from being hit on its side.
On the Bayesian, a young deckhand, Matthew Griffiths, later told the authorities that when the wind hit 20 knots, he woke up the captain, according to a person close to the crew (who said that neither of them was allowed to speak publicly). The captain then gave the order to wake up others, the person said.
At 3:51 a.m., the Bayesian started to drift — first 80 meters one way, then 80 meters another, its data transmitter shows. Maritime experts said this meant it was being blown around and probably dragging its anchor. It’s unclear whether the engines had been started.
At 4:02 a.m., a camera mounted on a boat in Porticello’s cove shows bright blue flashes of lightning. Three minutes later, another at a Porticello cafe captures the wind tearing down deck umbrellas. So much rain hits one of the cameras, it looks as if it’s being blasted with a hose.
Mr. Borner estimated that the wind gusts reached 60 knots, or nearly 70 miles an hour — just below hurricane strength — and said they had pushed his boat onto its side about 15 degrees, a serious lean but nothing close to capsizing.
Reports immediately after the disaster raised the possibility that the Bayesian had been hit by a tornado-like disturbance called a waterspout, but the authorities don’t think that happened. Still, the wind was doing something dangerous: It was changing direction.
According to a nearby weather station, it was blowing west-southwest then southwest, then north-northwest. This increased the chances of getting ambushed by a random gust that could slam into the side of a boat, which can tilt even a big vessel.
A third video shows the Bayesian rocking back and forth and beginning to lean. Then the lights on its giant mast blink out — all but the top one, which was powered by a battery.
By 4:06 a.m., the rain has turned into a blinding cascade. That same minute, the Bayesian’s location signal cuts out. Mr. Borner’s crew squinted through the nearly impenetrable haze of sea spray and rain and spotted a large object in the water. They first thought it was a reef.
“But I knew there was no reef,” Mr. Borner said.
It was the Bayesian, they now believe, knocked onto its side.
“Two Minutes” to Tragedy
At 4:34 a.m., a red emergency flare, bright as a meteor, shot into the sky. The storm had passed, and Mr. Borner and his first mate jumped into a small boat, zooming across the black water.
First they saw cushions floating. Then a flashing light. Then a life raft built for 12 packed with 15 people, bloodied and soaked to the skin, including a baby.
One person had a cut on the head, another on his chest. Some had already been bandaged. They were cold, wet and dazed. They were too shocked, Mr. Borner said, to say what happened.
As he loaded the survivors into his boat and began to head back to the Sir Robert, one woman pleaded with him not to leave.
“Please,” she told him. “Continue searching.”
Some people were still missing.
Mr. Borner decided to unload the survivors onto the Sir Robert, then send his small boat back. His crew gave them blankets and dry clothes. Some survivors were so shaken they needed to be led below deck by hand.
Nobody said much, Mr. Borner remembered.
One man told him: “I was the captain of this.”
Another said the boat had “sunk in two minutes.”
The woman who had begged him to keep searching sat huddled on the deck.
“Are you OK?” Mr. Borner asked her.
“No,” she replied. “I am not OK at all.’’
Mr. Borner said he later realized it was Angela Bacares, wife of Mr. Lynch and mother of Hannah Lynch. Neither had made it onto the life raft. (Salamander Davoudi, a spokeswoman for Lynch family, told The Times that Ms. Bacares was not speaking to the media because she was grieving and wanted privacy.)
A few hours after, a string of ambulances arrived at Palermo’s main hospital. Dr. Domenico Cipolla, the head of pediatric emergency, evaluated the youngest survivor, a 1-year-old girl.
The baby was OK, Dr. Cipolla said, but she had experienced quite an ordeal. She and her mother had been sleeping on a sofa on deck because of the rough sea, Dr. Cipolla said, when the boat suddenly lurched and threw them to the deck.
A moment later the boat turned completely on its side, the baby’s father told the doctor, flipping his hand as he described it. The doctor said the mother told him that she and her baby were hurled into the water and that her baby nearly slipped away. But then she grabbed her and swam to a nearby life raft, which was designed to deploy automatically.
The parents were later identified as Charlotte Golunski, a colleague of Mr. Lynch, and James Emslie. Ms. Golunski did not respond to several messages left for her, and efforts to reach Mr. Emslie were unsuccessful.
Mistakes by the Crew?
The biggest question that investigators are focused on is how the Bayesian filled with water so fast. To many in the yachting world, it doesn’t make sense.
The boat had been built with several watertight compartments under the deck, to prevent water from spreading from one area to others. And it had been approved as safe by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, part of Britain’s Department for Transport, and by the American Bureau of Shipping, a private company that reviews boat designs.
On top of that, one Italian official and underwater video footage broadcast on Italian television indicated that there were no holes or other structural damage visible in the hull.
Even so, the Bayesian, like many superyachts, had all kinds of openings in which water could theoretically get in: big air vents for the engines; smaller ones for the kitchen, crew quarters and guest cabins; large glass doors at the back and the sides so that people could walk onto the deck; and various hatches for crew and passenger access.
In interviews with Mr. Costantino, the chief executive of the Italian Sea Group, and his spokeswoman, the company accused the crew of leaving hatches open during the storm, including a doorway-size opening on the left rear of the hull, close to the water line. The spokeswoman claimed that hatch was the only place where so much water could have come gushing in.
The company speculated that the crew did not close a watertight door between this hatch and the engine room. A flooded engine room might explain the sudden blackout that killed the mast lights and then, a few minutes later, the location transmitter.
But witnesses, an Italian official familiar with the investigation and the underwater video challenged the company’s versions of events. The footage appeared to show the watertight door to the engine room closed, and the Italian official said the divers had not seen any open hatches on the hull.
Mr. Borner also said that after rescuing the captain, he asked him if he had shut the hatches. The captain said he had. Mr. Borner shared pictures taken by his guests a few moments before the Bayesian sank that appear to show that hull hatches were closed.
A Compromised Design?
The Bayesian’s origins go back to 2000. That year, Perini hired Ron Holland Design, a premier naval architectural firm, to design a series of 56-meter sailboats, said a person with knowledge of the timeline. As the superrich have become even richer, yachts have grown steadily bigger, and Perini was emerging as one of the world’s best-known builders of superyachts, often defined as motor yachts or sailboats longer than 24 meters, or 79 feet.
The Ron Holland firm, based in Ireland at the time, drew up plans for the hull, keel, rudder and, crucially, the placement of the masts — two masts. All other features, like the cabins, decks and vent system, were designed by Perini, according to the person, who did not want to be identified because of the possibility of legal action connected to the sinking.
In 2003, the first yacht in the series hit the water, the Burrasca (which means storm in Italian). Over the next four years, Perini built three more 56-meter superyachts from these blueprints, all with two masts. On Perini’s website, they look nearly identical.
Then came the Bayesian.
Construction on its hull began in 2005 at a shipyard in Tuzla, Turkey, according to the boat’s documents. But the original buyer for this yacht didn’t want the standard two-mast design. Instead, the Italian Sea Group said, he wanted the boat to be built with one large mast for better sailing performance.
That led to a radically different design, said three people with knowledge of what followed, and a cascade of modifications — some to accommodate the gigantic mast, and some apparently for stylistic or other reasons.
The most obvious departure from the previous Perini ships was the mast itself. Beyond being exceptionally tall — more than 40 feet higher than the original foremast — it was also very heavy, at least 24 tons of aluminum, possibly more. This alone would have challenged the boat’s stability, because so much weight was high above deck.
Since then, many yacht makers have switched to lighter, carbon-fiber masts.
“Technology moved on,” Mr. Costantino said.
Naval engineers pointed out that the heavier a yacht is up high, the more ballast it often needs down low — weight at the bottom of the boat to lower its center of gravity and resist its tendency to lean over.
Small notes on hull diagrams in the Bayesian’s documents show that the Turkish shipyard revised the ballast in July 2006, nearly 10 months after the keel was laid, which is one of the first steps of production.
“Values updated as from information by Yildiz,” the notes say in all caps, naming the shipyard.
But where this ballast was placed was curious, maritime experts said. Rather than spreading the ballast evenly across the bottom of the boat — which would have guaranteed the best stability — the builders stacked it toward the rear of the ship’s hull.
“When I first saw this, I couldn’t believe it,” said Mr. Roberts, the naval architect. “It made no sense to me.”
The ballast seems to have been pushed toward the rear of the boat to offset the single, heavy mast closer toward the front, Mr. Roberts concluded. He said he had never seen the main ballast used in such a design tactic before.
That was not the only change, experts said. A single mast would have plunged almost directly through the wheelhouse, an interior station where the ship can be controlled, so that was moved, too. A deck lounge was added, along with two tall doors on the sides. None of the other Perini yachts in the 56-meter series have these design elements.
The Bayesian sat lower in the water than other yachts in the same Perini series, said Stephen Edwards, the Bayesian’s captain from 2015 to 2020. Naval architects said this by itself would make it easier for water to pour through vents and other openings when the boat leans on its side.
Whenever a boat leans too far and water starts gushing in through open doors or vents, it can set off a dangerous downward spiral that is hard to stop and that can sink a boat in minutes.
Such risks are calculated and laid out in a lengthy, proprietary document — kind of a safety bible — for many vessels certified to ply the seas.
The Times has obtained that safety bible, called a stability book, for the Bayesian. Copies of the 88-page book are also sweeping through a global community of experts who are obsessively trying to solve the puzzle of how and why the boat sank. More than a dozen of those experts, including naval architects and engineers, found weaknesses in the Bayesian’s design that they said could have contributed to the disaster.
The stability book obtained by The Times was written before the Lynches bought the boat in 2014, when the yacht was called the Salute and owned by John Groenewoud, a Dutch businessman. In an email, he confirmed signing a contract for “the boat with 1 mast” in 2005, but declined to discuss any safety implications that may have had.
The Times obtained the stability book for another 56-meter Perini yacht, with two masts instead of one. A comparison of the boats showed that the Bayesian was significantly less stable.
Specifically, the data shows that the two-masted ship could lean at least 10 degrees farther onto its side before taking on dangerous amounts of water.
The documents also show that the Bayesian could begin taking on some water at angles that appeared to violate the safety threshold set by the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency.
The Italian Sea Group responded that the boat was in line with regulations and had been approved. When asked how that happened, an agency spokesman refused to clarify, citing the continuing investigations.
The other boat’s documents also showed that the sister yacht sat a little higher in the water than the Bayesian did, as Mr. Edwards emphasized. And under many circumstances, experts said, the sister ship had a better center of gravity and was more resistant to capsizing, two additional factors that would have made it safer.
“The other boat is, at least on paper, a better boat,” Mr. Roberts said.
To make boats safer, naval architects said they religiously ensured that vent openings are far from the water line. When showed a picture of a 56-meter Perini yacht that, like the Bayesian, had vents built into the hull, Philipp Luke, a Dutch naval architect, started violently shaking his head.
“No, no, no,” he said. “You don’t do that.”
In the end, several naval architects said, all these flaws may have come together at the worst time — in a sudden storm.
Two Spanish naval engineers, Guillermo Gefaell and Juan Manuel López, calculated that the sheer size of the Bayesian’s mast and rigging made the yacht a wind catcher, even with the sails down.
Writing for the Association of Naval and Ocean Engineers of Spain, they used a computer model to calculate what would have happened to the Bayesian if a strong gust of roughly 54 knots, around 62 mph, hit its side. Under those conditions, the Spanish engineers estimated, the Bayesian could lean dynamically and take on nearly a ton of water each second through an engine room vent.
In an interview, Mr. Gefaell noted that he, like almost everyone else, did not know everything that happened that night. But if the gusts were as strong as Mr. Borner estimated — 60 knots — the punch would have pushed the boat to an even more severe angle, his calculations showed, very quickly knocking the boat all the way over onto its side, as the witnesses recounted.
At that point, Mr. Gefaell said, “the boat was certainly lost.”
A Watery Maze
Within hours of the sinking, emergency divers plunged in. Their mission: Find survivors.
The Bayesian sat 160 feet below the surface, leaning on its right side on the seabed. The once-gleaming cabins were clogged with chairs, clothes, curtains and the enormous number of seat cushions that Ms. Bacares had brought onboard to make the boat more comfortable. The search was made even more difficult and dangerous, divers said, by the many mirrors installed below deck that now reflected back their lights in a disorienting, watery maze.
On the first day, divers found the body of the yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, floating near the boat. Over the next three days, they found the bodies of Mr. Lynch and four other passengers in a small cabin near the foot of a narrow staircase leading down from the deck to the passenger’s quarters. Finally, divers discovered the body of the last missing person, Hannah Lynch, trapped behind furniture in a nearby cabin.
One Italian official said the six passengers might have been trying to climb the main guest staircase when a surge of water poured down the stairs and knocked them back into the cabins. With the boat flipped on its side, water gushing in, and total darkness, it would have been nearly impossible for anyone below deck to escape, experts said.
The Italian authorities plan to raise the wreck to inspect it more closely. That could take months. In the meantime, at least two major investigations are unfolding, one by Italian prosecutors and the other by the British Marine Accident Investigation Branch.
From the first weeks after the accident, Italian prosecutors said that Mr. Cutfield, the captain, and two of his crew were under investigation.
Mr. Cutfield hasn’t said a word publicly and did not respond to messages asking for comment. Several crew members, when approached at a hotel in Sicily in August, said they had all been put under a gag order. When asked who imposed it, they responded: “No comment.”
In the yachting world, Mr. Cutfield has some solid references. Turgay Ciner, a Turkish industrial magnate and sailing enthusiast, employed him to run his yacht for 12 years.
“He never made any mistakes,” Mr. Ciner said.
Mr. Ciner, speaking by phone from Istanbul, recounted a bad storm near Capri about 10 years ago that Mr. Cutfield handled. They were sailing on another 56-meter Perini yacht, the Melek, a two-masted boat in the same series as the Bayesian. He said that Mr. Cutfield performed very well and was “one out of a hundred.”
Why Mr. Cutfield left in a lifeboat with the other survivors when a half dozen passengers were still missing is a matter Italian prosecutors are looking into.
But several yacht captains have defended Mr. Cutfield, saying that whatever happened that night, it happened very quickly.
When a boat sinks fast, said Adam Hauck, an American yacht captain, there’s not much hope for anyone still onboard. The adage of the captain going down with the ship, he said, is antiquated and unrealistic.
“It’s not like a Titanic movie where you’re going through the water and you can just look in the rooms,” Mr. Hauck said. “At some point, you can’t go back for people.”

Russia’s Swift March Forward in Ukraine’s East
For much of the past year, Russian troops launched bloody assaults on Ukrainian positions that often yielded only limited gains. But the relentless attacks are now starting to pay off: In October, Russia made its largest territorial gains since the summer of 2022, as Ukrainian lines buckled under sustained pressure.
Over the past month, Russian forces have seized more than 160 square miles of land in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, the main theater of the war today. That has allowed them to take control of strategic towns that anchored Ukrainian defenses in the area, beginning with Vuhledar in early October. This past week, battle has raged in Selydove, which now appears lost.
Ultimately, experts say, these gains, among the swiftest of the war, will help the Russian army secure its flanks before launching an assault on the city of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the Donbas.
Russia’s rapid advance is a striking change from the situation last year, when the front lines remained mostly static, with both sides launching ambitious offensives that largely failed.
But the stalemate that defined 2023 laid the groundwork for Russia’s recent progress. However marginal the gains, Russia’s attacks gradually weakened the Ukrainian army to the point where its troops are so stretched that they can no longer hold some of their positions, Ukrainian soldiers and military analysts say.
Half of Russia’s territorial gains in Ukraine so far this year were made in the past three months alone, according to Pasi Paroinen, a military expert with the Finland-based Black Bird Group. “The situation in southeastern Donbas rapidly deteriorates,” he said.
Russia made a series of small gains in July across this southeastern pocket of the Donbas. It set its eyes on Pokrovsk, a key rail and road hub that Ukraine depends on to resupply its troops in the area.
In August, Ukraine’s defensive lines buckled, and Russia rapidly advanced 10 miles toward Pokrovsk and closed in on Selydove from the west and north.
Russia’s march toward Pokrovsk slowed as it encountered several lines of Ukrainian defenses and Kyiv sent reinforcements. Instead of attacking Pokrovsk head-on, Russia tried to flank it from the south, tightening its grip around Selydove. Farther south it captured Vuhledar, a hilltop fortress town, after nearly encircling it.
Over the past month, Russia completed its march on Selydove and appears to have taken it this week. It also advanced on Kurakhove from three directions, looking to squeeze Ukrainian forces out of the city.
Mr. Paroinen likened the relentless assaults Ukrainian forces must try to fend off to “a constant game of whack-a-mole, with new crisis points emerging faster than they can be dealt with.” That allows Russia to quickly advance whenever it finds a weak spot.
Vincent Tourret, an analyst at the French Foundation for Strategic Research, pointed to other factors that have helped Russia’s advance, including its increased use of powerful guided bombs, which can destroy fortified enemy positions, and a lack of Ukrainian fortifications in the area where the fighting is now taking place.
“Ukraine’s defenses are more and more battered, the terrain is more and more favorable for Russian offensives and, on top of that, the Russians have a better impact” with the guided bombs, Mr. Tourret said. “The three factors combine to explain the increase in Russian gains.”
Ukrainian forces have also suffered from serious personnel shortages that have them largely outmanned on the battlefield. To address the problem, Oleksandr Lytvynenko, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Parliament on Tuesday that an additional 160,000 people would be drafted, with the goal of raising the manning of units to 85 percent.
In the past few months or so, Russian forces broke through Ukrainian strongholds that had sustained prolonged fighting, such as Chasiv Yar. Russian troops had long been thwarted by a canal dividing the town from its outskirts, which served as a natural barrier for the Ukrainians. But recently, according to Britain’s defense ministry, it is “highly likely” that Russia “crossed the canal and “approached the town’s boundaries.”
In other places, the Russian army has used a tactic of threatening encirclement to force Ukrainian forces to withdraw, such as in Selydove. Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of Ukraine’s Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group, said Selydove protected Pokrovsk’s southern flank and that its capture would help Russia position artillery and secure supply routes there.
The semi-circles formed around towns by Russia’s encirclement tactics have given the frontline in the Donbas a jagged appearance.
The Donbas, which comprises Ukraine’s two easternmost regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, has long been a prime objective for Russia.
Russia’s recent rapid advance points to another Ukrainian weakness, military experts say: a lack of fortifications.
After seizing the fortress town of Vuhledar earlier this month, Russian forces encountered largely open terrain with sparse Ukrainian defensive lines and few urban areas where Ukrainian troops could entrench to form stiff resistance. In just the past week, Russia advanced roughly six miles north of Vuhledar — an unusually swift pace compared with previous gains.
“The Russians are now well past the old frontline and its extensive minefields, which halted the previous offensives against Vuhledar back in 2023,” Mr. Paroinen said.
To make matters worse, Ukraine has weakened its positions in the Donbas by redeploying seasoned units from there to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise cross-border offensive this summer.
The troops have often been replaced by less experienced units that are struggling to fend off Russian assaults. Mr. Tourret noted that many units now manning the frontline in the Donbas are from Ukraine’s Territorial Defense — a force largely made up of civilians who volunteered to fight the Russian invaders in 2022, but lack the training and equipment of regular army units.
Mr. Paroinen said Russia’s recent rapid advance supports “the overall picture that we have of Ukrainian forces: Reserves are low, too many quality units are stuck in Kursk and Russia has enough force left to exploit any weaknesses in Ukrainian lines.”

How the U.S. Election Matters for the Rest of the World
The world doesn’t pick the U.S. president, but it will live with the consequences of whether Americans elect Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump. It’s a decision that will have globe-spanning consequences, from the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to climate change and global trade.
The world wants to know: What kind of superpower will America be in the years to come? Was Trump an aberration, or was President Biden?
I spoke with my fellow Times foreign correspondents about what’s at stake. One thing is clear: This election polarizes the world as much as it does the United States — but sometimes in unexpected ways.
Israel
Israelis, if they could, would vote by a large margin for Trump — the polls show that very clearly. But whoever wins, the long-term impact will probably be limited.
Israeli society, not to mention the government, is more opposed to Palestinian statehood and a two-state solution than it has been in decades. No U.S. president is likely to change that. President Harris would probably put more pressure on Israel to reach a cease-fire and open up talks with the Palestinians. But she would be unlikely to, say, cut off military support to Israel.
President Trump would perhaps be less bothered about Israel allowing Jewish settlers back into Gaza, as part of the Israeli government would like to do. He also talks a much more aggressive line on Iran than Harris, which pleases many Israelis. But you don’t quite know which side of the bed he’s going to wake up on. You get the sense he’s more risk averse than he sounds, and he recently appeared to rule out trying to topple the Iranian regime.
Because of that unpredictability, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may feel he can take more advantage of a Harris administration. So the internal Israeli thinking might be more nuanced than it seems.
Russia and Ukraine
This is an election that matters massively to Russia and Ukraine. Trump has said it is President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine’s fault that Russia invaded. Ukrainians worry that a President Trump would force a quick and dirty peace deal favorable to Russia. They hope a President Harris would continue to support them on the battlefield.
However, in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin sees much less of a difference between Trump and Harris on Ukraine than we might think. He believes that both Trump and Harris are going to be less committed to Ukraine than Biden.
Putin wants a deal, something that he can call a victory. He believes that Ukraine is a puppet of the United States. So he believes he can only get that deal in a negotiation with the U.S. president. He has publicly backed Harris. That might seem disingenuous, or counterintuitive, but Putin may think he can do business with her.
There is one way in which a Trump victory would unambiguously strengthen Putin: It would mean an America that’s far less engaged in the world and in Europe, which Putin sees as his rightful sphere of interest.
China
Whoever wins, the next U.S. president will be a hawk on China. But the people I speak to in Beijing are divided about which candidate would be better for China. The trade-off centers on two issues: tariffs and Taiwan.
Chinese economic officials are very aware that Trump has called for blanket tariffs on China’s exports, which could pose a serious threat to China’s economy. This is a country that is enormously dependent on foreign demand, especially from America, to keep its factories running and its workers employed. Manufacturing creates a lot of wealth, and it offsets China’s very serious housing market crash.
Meanwhile, the Chinese foreign policy world sees advantages to Trump’s winning the election.
China feels increasingly hemmed in by U.S. efforts, particularly by the Biden administration, to strengthen alliances with many of China’s neighbors: Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, India and above all Taiwan. Harris would probably continue those efforts. Trump is much less committed to building and maintaining international alliances.
And Trump has also shown much less interest in defending Taiwan. That is very welcome in Beijing.
Europe and NATO
For Europe, this U.S. election feels like the end of an era, whatever the outcome.
Depending on whom you talk to in Europe, a Trump victory is either a nightmare or a gift. Europe’s growing band of nativists — in Hungary, Italy, Germany and elsewhere — regard Trump as the leader of their movement. If he regains the White House, he would normalize and energize their hard line on immigration and national identity.
Meanwhile, most western European leaders are deeply anxious. Trump’s talk of slapping 20 percent tariffs onto everything sold to America, including European exports, could spell disaster for Europe’s economy. And, of course, Trump has repeatedly talked about leaving NATO.
Even if the United States doesn’t formally leave NATO, Trump could fatally undermine the alliance’s credibility if he says, “I’m not going to go fight for some small European country.”
If Harris wins, there is a feeling that she, too, will be preoccupied at home and more concerned with China, and will expect the Europeans to do more for themselves. There is a palpable sense in Europe that Biden was perhaps the last U.S. president to be personally attached to an alliance forged in the Cold War.
Global trade
Donald Trump says “tariff” is “the most beautiful word in the dictionary. More beautiful than love, more beautiful than respect.”
So this election is, among other things, a referendum on the entire global trade system, with U.S. voters making a choice that could affect the entire world.
Harris, if elected, would maintain targeted tariffs on Chinese goods on national security grounds. Trump is promising something much, much more aggressive, setting tariff levels that haven’t been seen in nearly a century: 10 to 20 percent on most foreign products, and 60 percent or more on goods made in China.
This would hit more than $3 trillion in U.S. imports, and probably cause multiple trade wars, as other countries retaliate with tariffs of their own. Most economists say we could end up with more tariffs, less trade, lower income and growth — a poorer world, essentially.
Can Trump just do that? Yes, he can. He has broad legal authority. And that would mean the United States is undermining the big international trade rules that it helped to create.
South Africa
There are some interesting differences in how people in Africa see Harris and Trump. Despite the fact that Trump has vulgarly dismissed African countries, some see him as a strong leader who gets things done. In many ways he resembles a lot of autocratic African leaders.
Harris, in Africa, is known for spending time in Zambia when she was growing up, as the granddaughter of an Indian diplomat stationed there. And her being of African descent resonates very deeply. She is seen as being very much of the continent.
Biden — and presumably Harris — wants African countries to decarbonize, because many still rely on fossil fuels for energy. Trump would probably not have that focus, and so his presidency might be desirable for countries that want to continue burning coal and oil and gas, instead of being dragged kicking and screaming into the clean energy transition.
South Africa is feeling a push and pull between the West, where it has the strongest economic ties, and the alliance of BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among others). It seems plausible that if Trump wins, he will be much more isolationist, and might have no problem watching countries like South Africa and Ethiopia draw even closer to BRICS.
Mexico
Mexico is facing significant challenges if Trump is elected. There will almost certainly be heightened tensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexico is the biggest U.S. trading partner, and it could face heavy tariffs. And it will be the next-door neighbor of a president who has threatened to use the U.S. military on Mexican soil.
But Mexico anticipates a tough immigration regime whoever wins. Under President Harris, that would probably mean continuity with the Biden administration policies that have become much more restrictive over time. Migration is a shared issue. Migrants from all over the world pass through Mexico to get to the U.S. border, and the United States can’t control the flow of migrants without Mexico’s assistance.
Trump has promised to deport 11 million people, mostly to Latin America — though experts are dubious that such a feat is even feasible. But even a small number of deportations could have huge consequences throughout the region.
Mexico has some leverage. But its leaders could really be backed into a corner by an emboldened Trump. And they know it.
Climate
The stakes could not be higher. The United States has emitted more carbon than any country in history, and is the second-biggest emitter right now after China. What it does next will impact the entire world’s ability to avert catastrophic climate change.
If Harris is elected, she is likely to press ahead with Biden’s policies of shifting to renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions. Less clear is whether she will restrict oil and gas production, as the United States is now producing more oil and gas than any country ever has.
Trump, if he wins, may not scrap the Biden-era policies altogether. But he could overturn dozens of measures that regulate emissions from cars and power plants, eviscerating the country’s ability to reduce emissions fast enough.
Trump’s actions could also leave China without serious competition in renewable energy technology like batteries and electric vehicles. China is already leading that race.
Whoever wins the U.S. election, the energy transition is already in motion. But speed and scale matter. Trump could slow the transition to a crawl, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, and the world.

Many of us find joy in looking back and taking stock of our reading lives, which is why we here at The New York Times Book Review decided to mark the first 25 years of this century with an ambitious project: to take a first swing at determining the most important, influential books of the era. In collaboration with the Upshot, we sent a survey to hundreds of literary luminaries, asking them to name the 10 best books published since Jan. 1, 2000.
Stephen King took part. So did Bonnie Garmus, Claudia Rankine, James Patterson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Elin Hilderbrand, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Roxane Gay, Marlon James, Sarah MacLean, Min Jin Lee, Jonathan Lethem and Jenna Bush Hager, to name just a few. And you can also take part! Vote here and let us know what your top 10 books of the century are.
We hope you’ll discover a book you’ve always meant to read, or encounter a beloved favorite you’d like to pick up again. Above all, we hope you’re as inspired and dazzled as we are by the breadth of subjects, voices, opinions, experiences and imagination represented here.

Tree of Smoke
Like the project of the title — an intelligence report that the newly minted C.I.A. operative William “Skip” Sands comes to find both quixotic and useless — the Vietnam-era warfare of Johnson’s rueful, soulful novel lives in shadows, diversions and half-truths. There are no heroes here among the lawless colonels, assassinated priests and faith-stricken NGO nurses; only villainy and vast indifference.

How to Be Both
This elegant double helix of a novel entwines the stories of a fictional modern-day British girl and a real-life 15th-century Italian painter. A more conventional book might have explored the ways the past and present mirror each other, but Smith is after something much more radical. “How to Be Both” is a passionate, dialectical critique of the binaries that define and confine us. Not only male and female, but also real and imaginary, poetry and prose, living and dead. The way to be “both” is to recognize the extent to which everything already is. — A.O. Scott, critic at large for The Times

Bel Canto
A famed opera singer performs for a Japanese executive’s birthday at a luxe private home in South America; it’s that kind of party. But when a group of young guerrillas swoops in and takes everyone in the house hostage, Patchett’s exquisitely calibrated novel — inspired by a real incident — becomes a piano wire of tension, vibrating on high.
My wife and I share books we love with our kids, and after I raved about “Bel Canto” — the voice, the setting, the way romance and suspense are so perfectly braided — I gave copies to my kids, and they all loved it, too. My son was in high school then, and he became a kind of lit-pusher, pressing his beloved copy into friends’ hands. We used to call him the Keeper of the Bel Canto. — Jess Walter, author of “Beautiful Ruins”

Men We Reaped
Sandwiched between her two National Book Award-winning novels, Ward’s memoir carries more than fiction’s force in its aching elegy for five young Black men (a brother, a cousin, three friends) whose untimely exits from her life came violently and without warning. Their deaths — from suicide and homicide, addiction and accident — place the hidden contours of race, justice and cruel circumstance in stark relief.

96
Wayward Lives,
Beautiful Experiments
A beautiful, meticulously researched exploration of the lives of Black girls whom early-20th-century laws designated as “wayward” for such crimes as having serial lovers, or an excess of desire, or a style of comportment that was outside white norms. Hartman grapples with “the power and authority of the archive and the limits it sets on what can be known” about poor Black women, but from the few traces she uncovers in the historical record, she manages to sketch moving portraits, restoring joy and freedom and movement to what, in other hands, might have been mere statistics. — Laila Lalami, author of “The Other Americans”
Liked it? Try “In the Wake: On Blackness and Being,” by Christina Sharpe or “All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley’s Sack, A Black Family Keepsake,” by Tiya Miles.

95
Bring Up the Bodies
The title comes from an old English legal phrase for summoning men who have been accused of treason to trial; in the court’s eyes, effectively, they are already dead. But Mantel’s tour-de-force portrait of Thomas Cromwell, the second installment in her vaunted “Wolf Hall” series, thrums with thrilling, obstinate life: a lowborn statesman on the rise; a king in love (and out of love, and in love again); a mad roundelay of power plays, poisoned loyalties and fateful realignments. It’s only empires, after all.
Liked it? Try “This Is Happiness,” by Niall Williams or “The Western Wind,” by Samantha Harvey.

94
On Beauty
Consider it a bold reinvention of “Howards End,” or take Smith’s sprawling third novel as its own golden thing: a tale of two professors — one proudly liberal, the other staunchly right-wing — whose respective families’ rivalries and friendships unspool over nearly 450 provocative, subplot-mad pages.
“You don’t have favorites among your children, but you do have allies.”

Station Eleven
Increasingly, and for obvious reasons, end-times novels are not hard to find. But few have conjured the strange luck of surviving an apocalypse — civilization preserved via the ad hoc Shakespeare of a traveling theater troupe; entire human ecosystems contained in an abandoned airport — with as much spooky melancholic beauty as Mandel does in her beguiling fourth novel.

92
The Days of Abandonment
There is something scandalous about this picture of a sensible, adult woman almost deranged by the breakup of her marriage, to the point of neglecting her children. The psychodrama is naked — sometimes hard to read, at other moments approaching farce. Just as Ferrante drew an indelible portrait of female friendship in her quartet of Neapolitan novels, here, she brings her all-seeing eye to female solitude.
“The circle of an empty day is brutal, and at night it tightens around your neck like a noose.”
It so simply encapsulates how solitude can, with the inexorable passage of time, calcify into loneliness and then despair. — Alexandra Jacobs

91
The Human Stain
Set during the Clinton impeachment imbroglio, this is partly a furious indictment of what would later be called cancel culture, partly an inquiry into the paradoxes of class, sex and race in America. A college professor named Coleman Silk is persecuted for making supposedly racist remarks in class. Nathan Zuckerman, his neighbor (and Roth’s trusty alter ego), learns that Silk, a fellow son of Newark, is a Black man who has spent most of his adult life passing for white. Of all the Zuckerman novels, this one may be the most incendiary, and the most unsettling. — A.O. Scott

The Sympathizer
Penned as a book-length confession from a nameless North Vietnamese spy as Saigon falls and new duties in America beckon, Nguyen’s richly faceted novel seems to swallow multiple genres whole, like a satisfied python: political thriller and personal history, cracked metafiction and tar-black comedy.

The Return
Though its Pulitzer Prize was bestowed in the category of biography, Matar’s account of searching for the father he lost to a 1990 kidnapping in Cairo functions equally as absorbing detective story, personal elegy and acute portrait of doomed geopolitics — all merged, somehow, with the discipline and cinematic verve of a novel.

The Collected Stories
of Lydia Davis
Brevity, thy name is Lydia Davis. If her work has become a byword for short (nay, microdose) fiction, this collection proves why it is also hard to shake; a conflagration of odd little umami bombs — sometimes several pages, sometimes no more than a sentence — whose casual, almost careless wordsmithery defies their deadpan resonance.
Liked it? Try “Ninety-Nine Stories of God,” by Joy Williams or “Tell Me: Thirty Stories,” by Mary Robison.

87
Detransition, Baby
Love is lost, found and reconfigured in Peters’s penetrating, darkly humorous debut novel. But when the novel’s messy triangular romance — between two trans characters and a cis-gendered woman — becomes an unlikely story about parenthood, the plot deepens, and so does its emotional resonance: a poignant and gratifyingly cleareyed portrait of found family.
Peters’s sly wit and observational genius, her ability to balance so many intimate realities, cultural forces and zeitgeisty happenings made my head spin. It got me hot, cracked me up, punched my heart with grief and understanding. I’m in awe of her abilities, and will re-read this book periodically just to remember how it’s done. — Michelle Tea, author of “Against Memoir”
Liked it? Try “I Heard Her Call My Name: A Memoir of Transition,” by Lucy Sante or “Didn’t Nobody Give a Shit What Happened to Carlotta,” by James Hannaham.

86
Frederick Douglass
It is not hard to throw a rock and hit a Great Man biography; Blight’s earns its stripes by smartly and judiciously excavating the flesh-and-bone man beneath the myth. Though Douglass famously wrote three autobiographies of his own, there turned out to be much between the lines that is illuminated here with rigor, flair and refreshing candor.
Liked it? Try “The Grimkes: The Legacy of Slavery in an American Family,” by Kerri K. Greenidge or “Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865,” by James Oakes.

85
Pastoralia
An ersatz caveman languishes at a theme park; a dead maiden aunt comes back to screaming, scatological life; a bachelor barber born with no toes dreams of true love, or at least of getting his toe-nubs licked. The stories in Saunders’s second collection are profane, unsettling and patently absurd. They’re also freighted with bittersweet humanity, and rendered in language so strange and wonderful, it sings.
Liked it? Try “Swamplandia!,” by Karen Russell or “Friday Black,” by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah.

84
The Emperor of All Maladies
The subtitle, “A Biography of Cancer,” provides some helpful context for what lies between the covers of Mukherjee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, though it hardly conveys the extraordinary ambition and empathy of his telling, as the trained oncologist weaves together disparate strands of large-scale history, biology and devastating personal anecdote.
Liked it? Try “Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,” by Atul Gawande, “Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery,” by Henry Marsh or “I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,” by Ed Yong.

When We Cease to Understand the World
You don’t have to know anything about quantum theory to start reading this book, a deeply researched, exquisitely imagined group portrait of tormented geniuses. By the end, you’ll know enough to be terrified. Labatut is interested in how the pursuit of scientific certainty can lead to, or arise from, states of extreme psychological and spiritual upheaval. His characters — Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger, among others — discover a universe that defies rational comprehension. After them, “scientific method and its object could no longer be prised apart.” That may sound abstract, but in Labatut’s hands the story of quantum physics is violent, suspenseful and finally heartbreaking. — A.O. Scott
Liked it? Try “The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of Reality,” by William Egginton, “The Noise of Time,” by Julian Barnes or “The End of Days,” by Jenny Erpenbeck; translated by Susan Bernofsky.

Hurricane Season
Her sentences are sloping hills; her paragraphs, whole mountains. It’s no wonder that Melchor was dubbed a sort of south-of-the-border Faulkner for her baroque and often brutally harrowing tale of poverty, paranoia and murder (also: witches, or at least the idea of them) in a fictional Mexican village. When a young girl impregnated by her pedophile stepfather unwittingly lands there, her arrival is the spark that lights a tinderbox.

81
Pulphead
When this book of essays came out, it bookended a fading genre: collected pieces written on deadline by “pulpheads,” or magazine writers. Whether it’s Sullivan’s visit to a Christian rock festival, his profile of Axl Rose or a tribute to an early American botanist, he brings to his subjects not just depth, but an open-hearted curiosity. Indeed, if this book feels as if it’s from a different time, perhaps that’s because of its generous receptivity to other ways of being, which offers both reader and subject a kind of grace.

The Story of the Lost Child
All things, even modern literature’s most fraught female friendship, must come to an end. As the now middle-aged Elena and Lila continue the dance of envy and devotion forged in their scrappy Neapolitan youth, the conclusion of Ferrante’s four-book saga defies the laws of diminishing returns, illuminating the twined psychologies of its central pair — intractable, indelible, inseparable — in one last blast of X-ray prose.

A Manual for
Cleaning Women
Berlin began writing in the 1960s, and collections of her careworn, haunted, messily alluring yet casually droll short stories were published in the 1980s and ’90s. But it wasn’t until 2015, when the best were collected into a volume called “A Manual for Cleaning Women,” that her prodigious talent was recognized. Berlin writes about harried and divorced single women, many of them in working-class jobs, with uncanny grace. She is the real deal. — Dwight Garner, book critic for The Times
“I hate to see anything lovely by myself.”
It’s so true, to me at least, and I have heard no other writer express it. — Dwight Garner
Liked it? Try “The Flamethrowers,” by Rachel Kushner or “The Complete Stories,” by Clarice Lispector; translated by Katrina Dodson.

78
Septology
You may not be champing at the bit to read a seven-part, nearly 700-page novel written in a single stream-of-consciousness sentence with few paragraph breaks and two central characters with the same name. But this Norwegian masterpiece, by the winner of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature, is the kind of soul-cleansing work that seems to silence the cacophony of the modern world — a pair of noise-canceling headphones in book form. The narrator, a painter named Asle, drives out to visit his doppelgänger, Asle, an ailing alcoholic. Then the narrator takes a boat ride to have Christmas dinner with some friends. That, more or less, is the plot. But throughout, Fosse’s searching reflections on God, art and death are at once haunting and deeply comforting.
I had not read Fosse before he won the Nobel Prize, and I wanted to catch up. Luckily for me, the critic Merve Emre (who has championed his work) is my colleague at Wesleyan, so I asked her where to start. I was hoping for a shortcut, but she sternly told me that there was nothing to do but to read the seven-volume “Septology” translated by Damion Searls. Luckily for me, I had 30 hours of plane travel in the next week or so, and I had a Kindle.
Reading “Septology” in the cocoon of a plane was one of the great aesthetic experiences of my life. The hypnotic effects of the book were amplified by my confinement, and the paucity of distractions helped me settle into its exquisite rhythms. The repetitive patterns of Fosse’s prose made its emotional waves, when they came, so much more powerful. — Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University

An American Marriage
Life changes in an instant for Celestial and Roy, the young Black newlyweds at the beating, uncomfortably realistic heart of Jones’s fourth novel. On a mostly ordinary night, during a hotel stay near his Louisiana hometown, Roy is accused of rape. He is then swiftly and wrongfully convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The couple’s complicated future unfolds, often in letters, across two worlds. The stain of racism covers both places.

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow
The title is Shakespeare; the terrain, more or less, is video games. Neither of those bare facts telegraphs the emotional and narrative breadth of Zevin’s breakout novel, her fifth for adults. As the childhood friendship between two future game-makers blooms into a rich creative collaboration and, later, alienation, the book becomes a dazzling disquisition on art, ambition and the endurance of platonic love.

Exit West
The modern world and all its issues can feel heavy — too heavy for the fancies of fiction. Hamid’s quietly luminous novel, about a pair of lovers in a war-ravaged Middle Eastern country who find that certain doors can open portals, literally, to other lands, works in a kind of minor-key magical realism that bears its weight beautifully.

Olive Kitteridge
When this novel-in-stories won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2009, it was a victory for crotchety, unapologetic women everywhere, especially ones who weren’t, as Olive herself might have put it, spring chickens. The patron saint of plain-spokenness — and the titular character of Strout’s 13 tales — is a long-married Mainer with regrets, hopes and a lobster boat’s worth of quiet empathy. Her small-town travails instantly became stand-ins for something much bigger, even universal.

The Passage of Power
The fourth volume of Caro’s epic chronicle of Lyndon Johnson’s life and times is a political biography elevated to the level of great literature. His L.B.J. is a figure of Shakespearean magnitude, whose sudden ascension from the abject humiliations of the vice presidency to the summit of political power is a turn of fortune worthy of a Greek myth. Caro makes you feel the shock of J.F.K.’s assassination, and brings you inside Johnson’s head on the blood-drenched day when his lifelong dream finally comes true. It’s an astonishing and unforgettable book. — Tom Perrotta, author of “The Leftovers”

Secondhand Time
Of all the 20th century’s grand failed experiments, few came to more inglorious ends than the aspiring empire known, for a scant seven decades, as the U.S.S.R. The death of the dream of Communism reverberates through the Nobel-winning Alexievich’s oral history, and her unflinching portrait of the people who survived the Soviet state (or didn’t) — ex-prisoners, Communist Party officials, ordinary citizens of all stripes — makes for an excoriating, eye-opening read.

The Copenhagen Trilogy
Ditlevsen’s memoirs were first published in Denmark in the 1960s and ’70s, but most English-language readers didn’t encounter them until they appeared in a single translated volume more than five decades later. The books detail Ditlevsen’s hardscrabble childhood, her flourishing early career as a poet and her catastrophic addictions, which left her wedded to a psychotic doctor and hopelessly dependent on opioids by her 30s. But her writing, however dire her circumstances, projects a breathtaking clarity and candidness, and it nails what is so inexplicable about human nature.

All Aunt Hagar’s Children
Jones’s follow-up to his Pulitzer-anointed historical novel, “The Known World,” forsakes a single narrative for 14 interconnected stories, disparate in both direction and tone. His tales of 20th-century Black life in and around Washington, D.C., are haunted by cumulative loss and touched, at times, by dark magical realism — one character meets the Devil himself in a Safeway parking lot — but girded too by loveliness, and something like hope.
“It was, I later learned about myself, as if my heart, on the path that was my life, had come to a puddle in the road and had faltered, hesitated, trying to decide whether to walk over the puddle or around it, or even to go back.”
The metaphor is right at the edge of corniness, but it's rendered with such specificity that it catches you off guard, and the temporal complexity — the way the perspective moves forward, backward and sideways in time — captures an essential truth about memory and regret. — A.O. Scott

The New Jim Crow
One year into Barack Obama’s first presidential term, Alexander, a civil rights attorney and former Supreme Court clerk, peeled back the hopey-changey scrim of early-aughts America to reveal the systematic legal prejudice that still endures in a country whose biggest lie might be “with liberty and justice for all.” In doing so, her book managed to do what the most urgent nonfiction aims for but rarely achieves: change hearts, minds and even public policy.

The Friend
After suffering the loss of an old friend and adopting his Great Dane, the book’s heroine muses on death, friendship, and the gifts and burdens of a literary life. Out of these fragments a philosophy of grief springs like a rabbit out of a hat; Nunez is a magician. — Ada Calhoun, author of “Also a Poet: Frank O’Hara, My Father, and Me”
“The Friend” is a perfect novel about the size of grief and love, and like the dog at the book’s center, the book takes up more space than you expect. It’s my favorite kind of masterpiece — one you can put into anyone’s hand. — Emma Straub, author of “This Time Tomorrow”

We the Animals
The hummingbird weight of this novella — it barely tops 130 pages — belies the cherry-bomb impact of its prose. Tracing the coming-of-age of three mixed-race brothers in a derelict upstate New York town, Torres writes in the incantatory royal we of a sort of sibling wolfpack, each boy buffeted by their parents’ obscure grown-up traumas and their own enduring (if not quite unshakable) bonds.

The Plot Against America
What if, in the 1940 presidential election, Charles Lindbergh — aviation hero, America-firster and Nazi sympathizer — had defeated Franklin Roosevelt? Specifically, what would have happened to Philip Roth, the younger son of a middle-class Jewish family in Newark, N.J.? From those counterfactual questions, the adult Roth spun a tour de force of memory and history. Ever since the 2016 election his imaginary American past has pulled closer and closer to present-day reality. — A.O. Scott

The Great Believers
It’s mid-1980s Chicago, and young men — beautiful, recalcitrant boys, full of promise and pure life force — are dying, felled by a strange virus. Makkai’s recounting of a circle of friends who die one by one, interspersed with a circa-2015 Parisian subplot, is indubitably an AIDS story, but one that skirts po-faced solemnity and cliché at nearly every turn: a bighearted, deeply generous book whose resonance echoes across decades of loss and liberation.

Veronica
Set primarily in a 1980s New York crackling with brittle glamour and real menace, “Veronica” is, on the face of it, the story of two very different women — the fragile former model Alison and the older, harder Veronica, fueled by fury and frustrated intelligence. It's a fearless, lacerating book, scornful of pieties and with innate respect for the reader’s intelligence and adult judgment.

10:04
How closely does Ben Lerner, the very clever author of “10:04,” overlap with its unnamed narrator, himself a poet-novelist who bears a remarkable resemblance to the man pictured on its biography page? Definitive answers are scant in this metaphysical turducken of a novel, which is nominally about the attempts of a Brooklyn author, burdened with a hefty publishing advance, to finish his second book. But the delights of Lerner’s shimmering self-reflexive prose, lightly dusted with photographs and illustrations, are endless.
“Shaving is a way to start the workday by ritually not cutting your throat when you’ve the chance.”
“10:04” is filled with sentences that cut this close to the bone. Comedy blends with intimations of the darkest aspects of our natures, and of everyday life. Who can shave anymore without recalling this “Sweeney Todd”-like observation? — Dwight Garner

Demon Copperhead
In transplanting “David Copperfield” from Victorian England to modern-day Appalachia, Kingsolver gives the old Dickensian magic her own spin. She reminds us that a novel can be wildly entertaining — funny, profane, sentimental, suspenseful — and still have a social conscience. And also that the injustices Dickens railed against are still very much with us: old poison in new bottles. — A.O. Scott

Heavy
What is the psychic weight of secrets and lies? In his unvarnished memoir, Laymon explores the cumulative mass of a past that has brought him to this point: his Blackness; his fraught relationship to food; his family, riven by loss and addiction and, in his mother’s case, a kind of pathological perfectionism. What emerges is a work of raw emotional power and fierce poetry.

Middlesex
Years before pronouns became the stuff of dinner-table debates and email signatures, “Middlesex” offered the singular gift of an intersex hero — “sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation on my fifth chromosome!” — whose otherwise fairly ordinary Midwestern life becomes a radiant lens on recent history, from the burning of Smyrna to the plush suburbia of midcentury Grosse Pointe, Mich. When the teenage Calliope, born to doting Greek American parents, learns that she is not in fact a budding young lesbian but biologically male, it’s less science than assiduously buried family secrets that tell the improbable, remarkable tale.

Stay True
An unlikely college friendship — Ken loves preppy polo shirts and Pearl Jam, Hua prefers Xeroxed zines and Pavement — blossoms in 1990s Berkeley, then is abruptly fissured by Ken’s murder in a random carjacking. Around those bare facts, Hsu’s understated memoir builds a glimmering fortress of memory in which youth and identity live alongside terrible, senseless loss.

Nickel and Dimed
Waitress, hotel maid, cleaning woman, retail clerk: Ehrenreich didn’t just report on these low-wage jobs; she actually worked them, trying to construct a life around merciless managers and wildly unpredictable schedules, while also getting paid a pittance for it. Through it all, Ehrenreich combined a profound sense of moral outrage with self-deprecating candor and bone-dry wit. — Jennifer Szalai, nonfiction book critic for The Times

The Flamethrowers
Motorcycle racing across the arid salt flats of Utah; art-star posturing in the downtown demimonde of 1970s New York; anarchist punk collectives and dappled villas in Italy: It’s all connected (if hardly contained) in Kushner’s brash, elastic chronicle of a would-be artist nicknamed Reno whose lust for experience often outstrips both sense and sentiment. The book’s ambitions rise to meet her, a churning bedazzlement of a novel whose unruly engine thrums and roars.

The Looming Tower
What happened in New York City one incongruously sunny morning in September was never, of course, the product of some spontaneous plan. Wright’s meticulous history operates as a sort of panopticon on the events leading up to that fateful day, spanning more than five decades and a geopolitical guest list that includes everyone from the counterterrorism chief of the F.B.I. to the anonymous foot soldiers of Al Qaeda.

Tenth of December
For all of their linguistic invention and anarchic glee, Saunders’s stories are held together by a strict understanding of the form and its requirements. Take plot: In “Tenth of December,” his fourth and best collection, readers will encounter an abduction, a rape, a chemically induced suicide, the suppressed rage of a milquetoast or two, a veteran’s post-traumatic impulse to burn down his mother’s house — all of it buffeted by gusts of such merriment and tender regard and daffy good cheer that you realize only in retrospect how dark these morality tales really are.
Nobody writes like George Saunders. He has cultivated a genuinely original voice, one that is hilarious and profound, tender and monstrous, otherworldly and deeply familiar, much like the American psyche itself. With each of these stories, you feel in the hands of a master — because you are. — Matthew Desmond, author of “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City”

Runaway
On one level, the title of Munro’s 11th short-story collection refers to a pet goat that goes missing from its owners’ property; but — this being Munro — the deeper reference is to an unhappy wife in the same story, who dreams of leaving her husband someday. Munro’s stories are like that, with shadow meanings and resonant echoes, as if she has struck a chime and set the reverberations down in writing.

Call it a backwoods tragedy, stripped to the bone, or a spare requiem for the American West: Johnson’s lean but potent novella carves its narrative from the forests and dust-bowl valleys of Spokane in the early decades of the 20th century, following a day laborer named Robert Grainier as he processes the sudden loss of his young family and bears witness to the real-time formation of a raw, insatiable nation.

Life After Life
Can we get life “right”? Are there choices that would lead, finally, to justice or happiness or save us from pain? Atkinson wrestles with these questions in her brilliant “Life After Life” — a historical novel, a speculative novel, a tale of time travel, a moving portrait of life before, during and in the aftermath of war. It gobbles up genres and blends them together until they become a single, seamless work of art. I love this goddamn book. — Victor LaValle, author of “Lone Women”
“‘Fox Corner — that’s what we should call the house. No one else has a house with that name and shouldn’t that be the point?’
‘Really?’ Hugh said doubtfully. ‘It’s a little whimsical, isn’t it? It sounds like a children’s story. The House at Fox Corner.’
‘A little whimsy never hurt anyone.’
‘Strictly speaking, though,’ Hugh said, ‘can a house be a corner? Isn’t it at one?’
So this is marriage, Sylvie thought.”

Trust
How many ways can you tell the same story? Which one is true? These questions and their ethical implications hover over Diaz’s second novel. It starts out as a tale of wealth and power in 1920s New York — something Theodore Dreiser or Edith Wharton might have taken up — and leaps forward in time, across the boroughs and down the social ladder, breathing new vitality into the weary tropes of historical fiction. — A.O. Scott
Be prepared for some serious mind games! Set in New York City in the 1920s and ’30s, the story of a Manhattan financier and his high-society wife is told through four “books” — a novel, a manuscript, a memoir and a journal. But which version should you trust? Is there even one true reality?
As we sift our way through these competing narratives, Diaz serves us clues and red herrings in equal measure. We know we are being gamed, but we’re not sure exactly which character is gaming us. While each reader will draw their own conclusion when they reach the end of this complex and thrilling book, what is never disputed is the ease with which money and power can bend reality itself. — Dua Lipa, singer and songwriter behind the Service95 Book Club

The Vegetarian
One ordinary day, a young housewife in contemporary Seoul wakes up from a disturbing dream and simply decides to … stop eating meat. As her small rebellion spirals, Han’s lean, feverish novel becomes a surreal meditation on not just what the body needs, but what a soul demands.
“I want to swallow you, have you melt into me and flow through my veins.”
“The Vegetarian” is a short novel with a mysterious, otherworldly air. It feels haunted, oppressive … It’s a story about hungers and starvation and desire, and how these become intertwined.” — Silvia Moreno-Garcia, author of “Mexican Gothic”

Persepolis
Drawn in stark black-and-white panels, Satrapi’s graphic novel is a moving account of her early life in Iran during the Islamic Revolution and her formative years abroad in Europe. The first of its two parts details the impacts of war and theocracy on both her family and her community: torture, death on the battlefield, constant raids, supply shortages and a growing black market. Part 2 chronicles her rebellious, traumatic years as a teenager in Vienna, as well as her return to a depressingly restrictive Tehran. Devastating — but also formally inventive, inspiring and often funny — “Persepolis” is a model of visual storytelling and personal narrative.

Mercies are few and far between in Morrison’s ninth novel, set on the remote colonial land of a 17th-century farmer amid his various slaves and indentured servants (even the acquisition of a wife, imported from England, is strictly transactional). Disease runs rampant and children die needlessly; inequity is everywhere. And yet! The Morrison magic, towering and magisterial, endures.

The Goldfinch
For a time, it seemed as if Tartt’s vaunted 1992 debut, “The Secret History,” might be her only legacy, a once-in-a-career comet zinging across the literary sky. Then, more than a decade after the coolish reception to her 2002 follow-up, “The Little Friend,” came “The Goldfinch” — a coming-of-age novel as narratively rich and riveting as the little bird in the Dutch painting it takes its title from is small and humble. That 13-year-old Theo Decker survives the museum bombing that kills his mother is a minor miracle; the tiny, priceless souvenir he inadvertently grabs from the rubble becomes both a talisman and an albatross in this heady, haunted symphony of a novel.

The Argonauts
Call it a memoir if you must, but this is a book about the necessity — and also the thrill, the terror, the risk and reward — of defying categories. Nelson is a poet and critic, well versed in pop culture and cultural theory. The text she interprets here is her own body. An account of her pregnancy, her relationship with the artist Harry Dodge and the early stages of motherhood, “The Argonauts” explores queer identity, gender politics and the meaning of family. What makes Nelson such a valuable writer is her willingness to follow the sometimes contradictory rhythms of her own thinking in prose that is sharp, supple and disarmingly heartfelt. — A.O. Scott

The Fifth Season
“The Fifth Season” weaves its story in polyphonic voice, utilizing a clever story structure to move deftly through generational time. Jemisin delivers this bit of high craft in a fresh, unstuffy voice — something rare in high fantasy, which can take its Tolkien roots too seriously. From its heartbreaking opening (a mother’s murdered child) to its shattering conclusion, Jemisin shows the power of what good fantasy fiction can do. “The Fifth Season” explores loss, grief and personhood on an intimate level. But it also takes on themes of discrimination, human breeding and ecological collapse with an unflinching eye and a particular nuance. Jemisin weaves a world both horrifyingly familiar and unsettlingly alien. — Rebecca Roanhorse, author of “Mirrored Heavens”

Postwar
By the time this book was published in 2005, there had already been innumerable volumes covering Europe’s history since the end of World War II. Yet none of them were quite like Judt’s: commanding and capacious, yet also attentive to those stubborn details that are so resistant to abstract theories and seductive myths. The writing, like the thinking, is clear, direct and vivid. And even as Judt was ruthless when reflecting on Europe’s past, he maintained a sense of contingency throughout, never succumbing to the comfortable certainty of despair. — Jennifer Szalai

of Seven Killings
“Brief”? For a work spanning nearly 700 pages, that word is, at best, a winky misdirection. To skip even a paragraph, though, would be to forgo the vertiginous pleasures of James’s semi-historical novel, in which the attempted assassination of an unnamed reggae superstar who strongly resembles Bob Marley collides with C.I.A. conspiracy, international drug cartels and the vibrant, violent Technicolor of post-independence Jamaica.

Not a word is wasted in Keegan’s small, burnished gem of a novel, a sort of Dickensian miniature centered on the son of an unwed mother who has grown up to become a respectable coal and timber merchant with a family of his own in 1985 Ireland. Moralistically, though, it might as well be the Middle Ages as he reckons with the ongoing sins of the Catholic Church and the everyday tragedies wrought by repression, fear and rank hypocrisy.
This is the book I would like to have written because its sentences portray a life — in all its silences, subtleties and defenses — that I would hope to live if its circumstances were mine.

H Is for Hawk
I read “H Is for Hawk” when I was writing my own memoir, and it awakened me to the power of the genre. It is a book supposedly about training a hawk named Mabel but really about wonder and loss, discovery and death. We discover a thing, then we lose it. The discovering and the losing are two halves of the same whole. Macdonald knows this and she shows us, weaving the loss of her father through the partial taming (and taming is always partial) of this hawk. — Tara Westover, author of “Educated”
“There is a time in life when you expect the world to be always full of new things. And then comes a day when you realize that is not how it will be at all. You see that life will become a thing made of holes. Absences. Losses. Things that were there and are no longer.”

A Visit From the Goon Squad
In the good old pre-digital days, artists used to cram 15 or 20 two-and-a-half-minute songs onto a single vinyl LP. Egan accomplished a similar feat of compression in this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, a compact, chronologically splintered rock opera with (as they say nowadays) no skips. The 13 linked stories jump from past to present to future while reshuffling a handful of vivid characters. The themes are mighty but the mood is funny, wistful and intimate, as startling and familiar as your favorite pop album. — A.O. Scott

“The Savage Detectives” is brash, hilarious, beautiful, moving. It’s also over 600 pages long, which is why I know that my memory of reading it in a single sitting is definitely not true. Still, the fact that it feels that way is telling. I was not the same writer I’d been before reading it, not the same person.

The Years
Spanning decades, this is an outlier in Ernaux’s oeuvre; unlike her other books, with their tight close-ups on moments in her life, here such intimacies are embedded in the larger sweep of social history. She moves between the chorus of conventional wisdom and the specifics of her own experiences, showing how even an artist with such a singular vision could recognize herself as a creature of her cohort and her culture. Most moving to me is how she begins and ends by listing images she can still recall — a merry-go-round in the park; graffiti in a restroom — that have been inscribed into her memory, yet are ultimately ephemeral. — Jennifer Szalai

Fun Home
“A queer business.” That’s how Bechdel describes her closeted father’s death after he steps in the path of a Sunbeam Bread truck. The phrase also applies to her family’s funeral home concern; their own Victorian, Addams-like dwelling; and this marvelous graphic memoir of growing up gay and O.C.D.-afflicted (which generated a remarkable Broadway musical). You forget, returning to “Fun Home,” that the only color used is a dreamy gray-blue; that’s how vivid and particular the story is. Even the corpses crackle with life. — Alexandra Jacobs
I read “Fun Home” with creative writing students in a course I teach at Dartmouth College called “Investigative Memoir.” The first time I taught it, a student wrote in their anonymous course evaluation, “I should not have been exposed to this” — the censorious voice tends to be passive. The last time I taught it, a student said that if they’d found this in their high school library — in a state in which such books are now all but illegal in high school libraries — it would have changed their life. I’m long past my schooling, but “Fun Home” still changes my life every time I return. — Jeff Sharlet, author of “The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War”

Citizen
“I, too, am America,” Langston Hughes wrote, and with “Citizen” Rankine stakes the same claim, as ambivalently and as defiantly as Hughes did. This collection — which appeared two years after Trayvon Martin’s death, and pointedly displays a hoodie on its cover like the one Martin wore when he was killed — lays out a damning indictment of American racism through a mix of free verse, essayistic prose poems and visual art; a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist in both poetry and criticism (the first book ever nominated in two categories), it took home the prize in poetry in a deserving recognition of Rankine’s subtle, supple literary gifts.

As Hurricane Katrina bears down on the already battered bayou town of Bois Sauvage, Miss., a motherless 15-year-old girl named Esch, newly pregnant with a baby of her own, stands in the eye of numerous storms she can’t control: her father’s drinking, her brothers’ restlessness, an older boy’s easy dismissal of her love.

Oh, to be the live-in houseguest of a wealthy friend!

As the timeline implies, though, the specter of AIDS looms not far behind, perched like a gargoyle amid glittering evocations of cocaine and Henry James.

Sing, Unburied, Sing
Road trips aren’t supposed to be like this: an addled addict mother dragging her 13-year-old son and his toddler sister across Mississippi to retrieve their father from prison, and feeding her worst habits along the way. Grief and generational trauma haunt the novel, as do actual ghosts, the unrestful spirits of men badly done by. But Ward’s unflinching prose is not a punishment; it loops and soars in bruising, beautiful arias.
“Home is about the earth. Whether the earth open up to you. Whether it pull you so close the space between you and it melt and it beats like your heart. Same Time.”
“This passage from ‘Sing, Unburied, Sing’ means so much to me. Richie says it to the protagonist, Jojo. He’s a specter, a child ghost, a deeply wounded wanderer, and yet also so wise.” — Imani Perry, author of “Breathe” and “South to America”

Two questions arise: 1) Who is the real genius? 2) Who is Ludo’s father? Ludo’s search for the answer to No. 2 propels the plot of this funny, cruel, compassionate, typographically bananas novel.

Cloud Atlas
Mitchell’s almost comically ambitious novel is indeed a kind of cumulus: a wild and woolly condensation of ideas, styles and far-flung milieus whose only true commonality is the reincarnated soul at its center. The book’s six nesting narratives — from 1850s New Zealand through 1930s Belgium, groovy California, recent-ish England, dystopian Korea and Hawaii — also often feel like a postmodern puzzle-box that whirls and clicks as its great world(s) spin, throwing off sparks of pulp, philosophy and fervid humanism.

(In the sequel, she’d have a Substack.) Ifemelu’s entanglements with various men undergird a rich and rough tapestry of life in Barack Obama’s America and beyond. And Adichie’s sustained examination of absurd social rituals — like the painful relaxation of professionally “unacceptable” hair, for example — is revolutionary. — Alexandra Jacobs

It’s also a testament to the piercing elegance of McEwan’s prose that “Atonement” makes us care so much.

I hate “Random Family.” It robbed us nonfiction writers of all our excuses: Well, it’s easier for fiction writers to achieve that level of interiority. Until “Random Family” entered the chat. It’s easier to create emotion on screen. Until “Random Family” entered the chat. It’s impossible to capture and understand a community if you’re an outsider. Until “Random Family” entered the chat.
Based on a decade of painstaking reporting in a social micro-world, it is a book of total immersion, profound empathy, rigorous storytelling, assiduous factualness, page-turning revelation and literary rizz. I hate “Random Family” because it took away all the excuses. I adore it because it raised the sky. — Anand Giridharadas, author of “The Persuaders: At the Front Lines of the Fight for Hearts, Minds, and Democracy”

The Overstory
We may never see a poem as lovely as a tree, but a novel about trees — they are both the stealth protagonists and the beating, fine-grained heart of this strange, marvelous book — becomes its own kind of poetry, biology lesson and impassioned environmental polemic in Powers’s hands. To know that our botanical friends are capable of communication and sacrifice, sex and memory, is mind-altering. It is also, you might say, credit overdue: Without wood pulp, after all, what would the books we love be made of?

Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage
Munro’s stories apply pointillistic detail and scrupulous psychological insight to render their characters’ lives in full, at lengths that test the boundaries of the term “short fiction.” (Only one story in this book is below 30 pages, and the longest is over 50.) The collection touches on many of Munro’s lifelong themes — family secrets, sudden reversals of fortune, sexual tensions and the unreliability of memory — culminating in a standout story about a man confronting his senile wife’s attachment to a fellow resident at her nursing home.

Behind the Beautiful Forevers
If the smash movie “Slumdog Millionaire” gave the world a feel-good story of transcending caste in India via pluck and sheer improbable luck, Boo’s nonfiction exploration of several interconnected lives on the squalid outskirts of Mumbai is its sobering, necessary corrective. The casual violence and perfidy she finds there is staggering; the poverty and disease, beyond bleak. In place of triumph-of-the-human-spirit bromides, though, what the book delivers is its own kind of cinema, harsh and true.

Evicted
Like Barbara Ehrenreich or Michelle Alexander, Desmond has a knack for crystallizing the ills of a patently unequal America — here it’s the housing crisis, as told through eight Milwaukee families — in clear, imperative terms. If reading his nightmarish exposé of a system in which race and poverty are shamelessly weaponized and eviction costs less than accountability feels like outrage fuel, it’s prescriptive, too; to look away would be its own kind of crime.

Erasure
More than 20 years before it was made into an Oscar-winning movie, Everett’s deft literary satire imagined a world in which a cerebral novelist and professor named Thelonious “Monk” Ellison finds mainstream success only when he deigns to produce the most broad and ghettoized portrayal of Black pain. If only the ensuing decades had made the whole concept feel laughably obsolete; alas, all the 2023 screen adaptation merited was a title change: “American Fiction.”

Say Nothing
“Say Nothing” is an amazing accomplishment — a definitive, impeccably researched history of the Troubles, a grim, gripping thriller, an illuminating portrait of extraordinary people who did unspeakable things, driven by what they saw as the justness of their cause. Those of us who lived in the U.K. in the last three decades of the 20th century know the names and the events — we were all affected, in some way or another, by the bombs, the bomb threats, the assassinations and attempted assassinations. What we didn’t know was what it felt like to be on the inside of a particularly bleak period of history. This book is, I think, unquestionably one of the greatest literary achievements of the 21st century. — Nick Hornby, author of “High Fidelity”

Lincoln in the Bardo
A father mourns his young son, dead of typhoid; a president mourns his country riven by civil war. In Saunders’s indelible portrait, set in a graveyard populated by garrulous spirits, these images collide and coalesce, transforming Lincoln’s private grief — his 11-year-old boy, Willie, died in the White House in 1862 — into a nation’s, a polyphony of voices and stories. The only novel to date by a writer revered for his satirical short stories, this book marks less a change of course than a foregrounding of what has distinguished his work all along — a generosity of spirit, an ear acutely tuned to human suffering.

The Sellout
Part of this wild satire on matters racial, post-racial, maybe-racial and Definitely Not Racial in American life concerns a group known as the Dum Dum Donut Intellectuals. One of them has produced an expurgated edition of an American classic titled “The Pejorative-Free Adventures and Intellectual and Spiritual Journeys of African-American Jim and His Young Protégé, White Brother Huckleberry Finn, as They Go in Search of the Lost Black Family Unit.” Beatty’s method is the exact opposite: In his hands, everything sacred is profaned, from the Supreme Court to the Little Rascals. “The Sellout” is explosively funny and not a little bit dangerous: an incendiary device disguised as a whoopee cushion, or maybe vice versa. — A.O. Scott
Some voices are so sharp they slice right through reality to reveal everything we’ve been hiding or ignoring or didn’t know was there. This novel cut into me — as a writer and reader and American. It’s fearless and funny and unlike anything else I’ve read. — Charles Yu, author of “Interior Chinatown”

The Amazing Adventures
of Kavalier & Clay
Set during the first heyday of the American comic book industry, from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, Chabon’s exuberant epic centers on the Brooklyn-raised Sammy Clay and his Czech immigrant cousin, Joe Kavalier, who together pour their hopes and fears into a successful comic series even as life delivers them some nearly unbearable tragedies. Besotted with language and brimming with pop culture, political relevance and bravura storytelling, the novel won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2001.
“The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay” combines eloquent prose, captivating characters, a deeply researched setting and an adventure that previously only belonged to the pulps. High art and low art and who the heck cares? Chabon opened the doors not just for comic book nerds, but for every kind of nerd, including this gay one. Chabon’s book made me the writer I am, and I’m still dazzled by it: the century's first masterpiece. — Andrew Sean Greer, author of “Less”

Pachinko
“History has failed us, but no matter.” So begins Lee’s novel, the rich and roiling chronicle of a Korean family passing through four generations of war, colonization and personal strife. There are slick mobsters and disabled fishermen, forbidden loves and secret losses. And of course, pachinko, the pinball-ish game whose popularity often supplies a financial lifeline for the book’s characters — gamblers at life like all of us, if hardly guaranteed a win.

Outline
This novel is the first and best in Cusk’s philosophical, unsettling and semi-autobiographical Outline trilogy, which also includes the novels “Transit” and “Kudos.” In this one an English writer flies to Athens to teach at a workshop. Along the way, and once there, she falls into intense and resonant conversations about art, intimacy, life and love. Cusk deals, brilliantly, in uncomfortable truths. — Dwight Garner

The Road
There is nothing green or growing in McCarthy’s masterpiece of dystopian fiction, the story of an unnamed man and his young son migrating over a newly post-apocalyptic earth where the only remaining life forms are desperate humans who have mostly descended into marauding cannibalism. Yet McCarthy renders his deathscape in curious, riveting detail punctuated by flashes of a lost world from the man’s memory that become colorful myths for his son. In the end, “The Road” is a paean to parental love: A father nurtures and protects his child with ingenuity and tenderness, a triumph that feels redemptive even in a world without hope. — Jennifer Egan, author of “A Visit From the Goon Squad”

The Year of Magical Thinking
Having for decades cast a famously cool and implacable eye on everything from the Manson family to El Salvador, Didion suddenly found herself in a hellscape much closer to home: the abrupt death of her partner in life and art, John Gregory Dunne, even as their only child lay unconscious in a nearby hospital room. (That daughter, Quintana Roo, would be gone soon too, though her passing does not fall within these pages.) Dismantled by shock and grief, the patron saint of ruthless clarity did the only thing she could do: She wrote her way through it.

The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao
Díaz’s first novel landed like a meteorite in 2007, dazzling critics and prize juries with its mix of Dominican history, coming-of-age tale, comic-book tropes, Tolkien geekery and Spanglish slang. The central plotline follows the nerdy, overweight Oscar de León through childhood, college and a stint in the Dominican Republic, where he falls disastrously in love. Sharply rendered set pieces abound, but the real draw is the author’s voice: brainy yet inviting, mordantly funny, sui generis.

Gilead
The first installment in what is so far a tetralogy — followed by “Home,” “Lila” and “Jack” — “Gilead” takes its title from the fictional town in Iowa where the Boughton and Ames families reside. And also from the Book of Jeremiah, which names a place where healing may or may not be found: “Is there no balm in Gilead?” For John Ames, who narrates this novel, the answer seems to be yes. An elderly Congregationalist minister who has recently become a husband and father, he finds fulfillment in both vocation and family. Robinson allows him, and us, the full measure of his hard-earned joy, but she also has an acute sense of the reality of sin. If this book is a celebration of the quiet decency of small-town life (and mainline Protestantism) in the 1950s, it is equally an unsparing critique of how the moral fervor and religious vision of the abolitionist movement curdled, a century later, into complacency. — A.O. Scott
“Then he put his hat back on and stalked off into the trees again and left us standing there in that glistening river, amazed at ourselves and shining like the apostles. I mention this because it seems to me transformations just that abrupt do occur in this life, and they occur unsought and unawaited, and they beggar your hopes and your deserving.”
From a dog-eared, battered, underlined copy of Marilynne Robinson’s “Gilead,” I offer the following quote which undoes me every time I read it — transformation and its possibility is so much a part of what I read for. — Kate DiCamillo, novelist

Never Let Me Go
Kathy, Ruth and Tommy are boarders at an elite English school called Hailsham. Supervised by a group of “guardians,” the friends share music and rumors while navigating the shifting loyalties and heartbreaks of growing up. It’s all achingly familiar — at times, even funny. But things begin to feel first off, then sinister and, ultimately, tragic. As in so much of the best dystopian fiction, the power of “Never Let Me Go” to move and disturb arises from the persistence of human warmth in a chilly universe — and in its ability to make us see ourselves through its uncanny mirror. Is Ishiguro commenting on biotechnology, reproductive science, the cognitive dissonance necessary for life under late-stage capitalism? He’d never be so didactic as to tell you. What lies at the heart of this beautiful book is not social satire, but deep compassion.

Austerlitz
Sebald scarcely lived long enough to see the publication of his final novel; within weeks of its release, he died from a congenital heart condition at 57. But what a swan song it is: the discursive, dreamlike recollections of Jacques Austerlitz, a man who was once a small refugee of the kindertransport in wartime Prague, raised by strangers in Wales. Like the namesake Paris train station of its protagonist, the book is a marvel of elegant construction, haunted by memory and motion.

The Underground Railroad
“The Underground Railroad” is a profound revelation of the intricate aspects of slavery and nebulous shapes of freedom featuring an indomitable female protagonist: Cora from Georgia. The novel seamlessly combines history, horror and fantasy with philosophical speculation and cultural criticism to tell a compulsively readable, terror-laden narrative of a girl with a fierce inner spark who follows the mysterious path of her mother, Mabel, the only person ever known to have escaped from the Randall plantations.
I could hardly make it through this plaintively brutal novel. Neither could I put it down. “The Underground Railroad” bleeds truth in a way that few treatments of slavery can, fiction or nonfiction. Whitehead’s portrayals of human motivation, interaction and emotional range astonish in their complexity. Here brutality is bone deep and vulnerability is ocean wide, yet bravery and hope shine through in Cora’s insistence on escape. I rooted for Cora in a way that I never had for a character, my heart breaking with each violation of her spirit. Just as Cora inherits her mother’s symbolic victory garden, we readers of Whitehead’s imaginary world can inherit Cora’s courage. — Tiya Miles, author of “All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley’s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake”
“Mabel had packed for her adventure. A machete. Flint and tinder. She stole a cabin mate’s shoes, which were in better shape. For weeks, her empty garden testified to her miracle. Before she lit out she dug up every yam from their plot, a cumbersome load and ill-advised for a journey that required a fleet foot. The lumps and burrows in the dirt were a reminder to all who walked by. Then one morning they were all smoothed over. Cora got on her knees and planted anew. It was her inheritance.”

2666
Bolaño’s feverish, vertiginous novel opens with an epigraph from Baudelaire — “An oasis of horror in a desert of boredom” — and then proceeds, over the course of some 900 pages, to call into being an entire world governed in equal parts by boredom and the deepest horror. The book (published posthumously) is divided into five loosely conjoined sections, following characters who are drawn for varying reasons to the fictional Mexican city of Santa Teresa: a group of academics obsessed with an obscure novelist, a doddering philosophy professor, a lovelorn police officer and an American reporter investigating the serial murders of women in a case with echoes of the real-life femicide that has plagued Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. In Natasha Wimmer’s spotless translation, Bolaño’s novel is profound, mysterious, teeming and giddy: Reading it, you go from feeling like a tornado watcher to feeling swept up in the vortex, and finally suspect you might be the tornado yourself.

The Corrections
With its satirical take on mental health, self-improvement and instant gratification, Franzen’s comic novel of family disintegration is as scathingly entertaining today as it was when it was published at the turn of the millennium. The story, about a Midwestern matron named Enid Lambert who is determined to bring her three adult children home for what might be their father’s last Christmas, touches on everything from yuppie excess to foodie culture to Eastern Europe’s unbridled economy after the fall of communism — but it is held together, always, by family ties. The novel jumps deftly from character to character, and the reader’s sympathies jump with it; in a novel as alert to human failings as this one is, it is to Franzen’s enduring credit that his genuine affection for all of the characters shines through.
Sometimes we have a totemic connection to a book that deepens our appreciation. I had Jonathan Franzen's brand-new doorstop of a hardcover with me when I was trapped in an office park hotel outside Denver after 9/11. The marvelous, moving, often very funny novel kept me company when I needed company most. As Franzen himself wrote, “Fiction is a solution, the best solution, to the problem of existential solitude.” — Chris Bohjalian, author of “The Flight Attendant”

The Known World
This novel, about a Black farmer, bootmaker and former slave named Henry Townsend, is a humane epic and a staggering feat of wily American storytelling. Set in Virginia during the antebellum era, the milieu — politics, moods, manners — is starkly and intensely realized. When Henry becomes the proprietor of a plantation, with slaves of his own, the moral sands shift under the reader’s feet. Grief piles upon grief. But there is a glowing humanity at work here as well. Moments of humor and unlikely good will bubble up organically. Jones is a confident storyteller, and in “The Known World” that confidence casts a spell. This is a large novel that moves nimbly, and stays with the reader for a long time. — Dwight Garner

Wolf Hall
It was hard choosing the books for my list, but the first and easiest choice I made was “Wolf Hall.” (“The Mirror and the Light,” the third book in Mantel’s trilogy, was the second easiest.)
We see the past the way we see the stars, dimly, through a dull blurry scrim of atmosphere, but Mantel was like an orbital telescope: She saw history with cold, hard, absolute clarity. In “Wolf Hall” she took a starchy historical personage, Thomas Cromwell, and saw the vivid, relentless, blind-spotted, memory-haunted, grandly alive human being he must have been. Then she used him as a lens to show us the age he lived in, the vast, intricate spider web of power and money and love and need — right up until the moment the spider got him. — Lev Grossman, author of “The Bright Sword”

The Warmth of Other Suns
Wilkerson’s intimate, stirring, meticulously researched and myth-dispelling book, which details the Great Migration of Black Americans from South to North and West from 1915 to 1970, is the most vital and compulsively readable work of history in recent memory. This migration, she writes, “would become perhaps the biggest underreported story of the 20th century. It was vast. It was leaderless. It crept along so many thousands of currents over so long a stretch of time as to be difficult for the press truly to capture while it was under way.” Wilkerson blends the stories of individual men and women with a masterful grasp of the big picture, and a great deal of literary finesse. “The Warmth of Other Suns” reads like a novel. It bears down on the reader like a locomotive. — Dwight Garner

My Brilliant Friend
The first volume of what would become Ferrante’s riveting four-book series of Neapolitan novels introduced readers to two girls growing up in a poor, violent neighborhood in Naples, Italy: the diligent, dutiful Elena and her charismatic, wilder friend Lila, who despite her fierce intelligence is seemingly constrained by her family’s meager means. From there the book (like the series as a whole) expands as propulsively as the early universe, encompassing ideas about art and politics, class and gender, philosophy and fate, all through a dedicated focus on the conflicted, competitive friendship between Elena and Lila as they grow into complicated adults. It’s impossible to say how closely the series tracks the author’s life — Ferrante writes under a pseudonym — but no matter: “My Brilliant Friend” is entrenched as one of the premier examples of so-called autofiction, a category that has dominated the literature of the 21st century. Reading this uncompromising, unforgettable novel is like riding a bike on gravel: It’s gritty and slippery and nerve-racking, all at the same time.

About Serial Season 4
Right after Sept. 11, the United States created a brand-new criminal justice system at Guantánamo Bay. It was a prison and a court designed to deal with the people we had captured whom we suspected of being members of the Taliban or al Qaeda.
But to do what we wanted to do at Guantánamo — to interrogate detainees the way we wanted, to hold them indefinitely without charging them with a crime — we had to push aside the old, time-tested rules for detaining prisoners of war. And the consequences of that fell on ordinary people: thousands of military personnel, hundreds of prisoners, everybody scrambling through the same experiment.
There has been great journalism about the legal maneuvering to justify Guantánamo, and about the detainee abuse and the politics and policy. But “Serial” reporters Sarah Koenig and Dana Chivvis were after the inside stories, a picture of Guantánamo you could get only from the people who went through it. For years, though, all the best stories they heard about Guantánamo were off the record. But they stuck with it, figuring maybe once enough people were back in civilian life they’d be willing to tell those stories on the record. A couple of years ago, the “Serial” team started contacting people again: guards, interrogators, commanders, lawyers, chaplains, translators and former prisoners. More than a hundred people. And a remarkable number of them said: Okay, I’m ready. Here’s what happened.
“Serial” Season 4 is a history of Guantánamo told by people who lived through key moments in its evolution, who know things the rest of us don’t about what it’s like to be caught inside an improvised justice system.

Serial is a podcast from the creators of This American Life, hosted by Sarah Koenig. Serial tells one story — a true story — over the course of a season.
Season 1
A high-school senior named Hae Min Lee disappeared one day after school in 1999, in Baltimore County, Maryland. A month later, her body was found in a city park. She'd been strangled. Her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was arrested for the crime, and within a year, he was sentenced to life in prison. Listen here
Season 2
In May 2014, a U.S. Special Operations team in a Black Hawk helicopter landed in the hills of Afghanistan. Waiting for them were more than a dozen Taliban fighters and a tall American, who looked pale and out of sorts: Bowe Bergdahl. Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier, had been a prisoner of the Taliban for nearly five years, and now he was going home. Listen here
Season 3
“Serial” is heading back to court. This time, in Cleveland. Not for one extraordinary case; instead, Serial wanted to tackle the whole criminal justice system. To do that we figured we’d need to look at something different: ordinary cases. So we did. Inside these ordinary cases we found the troubling machinery of the criminal justice system on full display.

Early Voting Has Started. Here’s What to Watch.
When Election Day comes on Nov. 5, millions of voters will have already cast their ballots early, both by mail and in person. This page is tracking those votes and requests for absentee ballots as they come in.
Early voting surged in the 2020 presidential election, driving a massive increase in overall turnout and helping Joseph R. Biden Jr. secure his victory. Many states made early voting easier that year because of the pandemic, but over the last four years some states have passed laws that will make it harder for voters to cast ballots early in this election. The number of people who have requested absentee ballots in each state offers an indication of how strong the early turnout may be.

The strength of early voting in this election will be important for the campaigns of both former President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2020, about 60 percent of Democrats and 32 percent of Republicans who voted did so by mail, according to a study by the M.I.T. Election Data and Science Lab.

Despite Mr. Trump’s frequent false claims that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, Republicans have made efforts to encourage early voting in this election. In Pennsylvania, the party has pledged more than $10 million to persuade Republicans to vote by mail in November. But so far, the number of ballot requests made by registered Democrats in the state has far outpaced requests made by Republicans.
Among the states that made changes to early voting rules since 2020 were Georgia and North Carolina, both important swing states. In Georgia, the Republican legislature and governor passed a sweeping law that decreased the time to request absentee ballots, imposed strict new ID requirements for those ballots and significantly limited the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes.
North Carolina has added similar restrictions, and it sent absentee ballots to voters two weeks late this year after a court ordered the last-minute removal of Robert F. Kennedy’s name from the ballots. Hurricane Helene created challenges for voters in the state as well, causing significant damage and accessibility issues at 10 early voting sites.
This page will be regularly updated with the latest data on early voting in each state, and figures may change as new sources of information become available.

Tracking the House’s Most Competitive Races
The balance of power in the House of Representatives will likely be decided by 43 of the most competitive races, according to the most recent ratings by the Cook Political Report.
Republicans could maintain control of the chamber by winning 11 of the 25 seats rated as tossups if they also secure the seats rated Likely or Lean Republican. They have incumbents in 14 of those tossup seats.
Tossups
25 districts
|District||Incumbent||2022 margin|
|Alaska 1||Peltola|
D +9.9
| |
Representative Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native in Congress and the first Democrat in half a century to represent the state in the House, is one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country. Alaska has a ranked choice system in the general election, where her chief competitor is Nick Begich III, the Republican son of a prominent liberal political family in the state, whom she defeated in 2022.
|Ariz. 1||Schweikert|
R +0.9
| |
Seven-term Representative David Schweikert, a Republican, has emphasized his fiscal conservatism as he seeks re-election in the wealthy Phoenix suburbs of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. He faces Democrat Amish Shah, a state representative and emergency room doctor who hopes to ride a wave of voter turnout boosted by an abortion rights measure on the ballot.
|Ariz. 6||Ciscomani|
R +1.5
| |
Representative Juan Ciscomani, a first-term Republican, is again facing Kirsten Engel, the Democrat he defeated in 2022 by fewer than 6,000 votes. Mr. Ciscomani has centered his campaign around border security and economic issues, while Ms. Engel has emphasized protecting reproductive rights after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
|Calif. 13||Duarte|
R +0.4
| |
A freshman who won his seat in one of the closest elections in the country in 2022, Representative John Duarte is considered one of the most vulnerable House Republicans. Mr. Duarte, who has labored to separate himself from the national Republican brand, is facing a rematch with Adam Gray, a Democratic former state assemblyman who lost to Duarte last cycle by just a few hundred votes.
|Calif. 22||Valadao|
R +3.0
| |
With his roots as a dairy farmer and reputation for bucking his party, Republican Representative David Valadao has proved difficult to dislodge from his Central Valley seat. He was one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach President Donald J. Trump. He faces a rematch challenge from Rudy Salas, a Democratic former state assemblyman.
|Calif. 27||Garcia|
R +6.5
| |
Representative Mike Garcia, a Republican and former military pilot, has established a reputation in his Antelope Valley district as a relatively moderate lawmaker, helping him to survive successive Democratic efforts to unseat him. He faces a challenge this year from George Whitesides, a Democrat, a former NASA chief of staff and Virgin Galactic CEO.
|Calif. 41||Calvert|
R +4.7
| |
Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican who has served more than three decades in the House, is in a rematch with Democrat Will Rollins, who came close to beating him in 2022 in the Palm Springs-based district. Mr. Rollins is casting himself as a fresh face who is willing to work across the aisle.
|Calif. 45||Steel|
R +4.8
| |
Representative Michelle Steel, a two-term Republican from Orange County, Calif., and the first Korean-American woman ever elected to Congress, is battling for re-election in a district President Biden won in 2020. She has floundered on the issues of reproductive rights and abortion and is facing off against Derek Tran, a lawyer, Army veteran and the son of Vietnamese refugees.
|Colo. 8||Caraveo|
D +0.7
| |
Freshman Democrat Yadira Caraveo, a former doctor and political moderate who keeps a low profile, is fending off a challenge from Republican Gabe Evans, a state representative whose resume includes stints as an Army captain and police officer, in a newly created purple congressional district north of Denver.
|Iowa 1||Miller-Meeks|
R +6.8
| |
Second-term Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, is facing a rematch challenge from Democrat Christina Bohannan, a former law professor and state representative who has made protecting abortion rights the focal point of her campaign. Ms. Miller-Meeks has toiled to explain away her backing for a 2021 bill, the Life at Conception Act, that would have effectively criminalized abortions.
|Iowa 3||Nunn|
R +0.7
| |
Freshman Republican Representative Zach Nunn, a former state legislator who serves in the Air Force Reserve, faces Democrat Lanon Baccam, an Army veteran and former federal Agriculture Department official. Mr. Baccam has attacked Mr. Nunn over his opposition to abortion rights, while Mr. Nunn has tried to tie the Democrat to Biden administration economic policies he contends have made Iowans’ lives worse.
|Maine 2||Golden|
D +6.1
| |
Third-term Representative Jared Golden, a Democrat, has managed to defy political gravity in a district that voted for Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020 by frequently breaking with his party and courting Republican voters. This year, he faces his toughest challenge yet from Republican Austin Theriault, a state representative and former NASCAR driver endorsed by Mr. Trump.
|Mich. 7||open|
D +5.4
| |
Curtis Hertel, a Democratic former state senator, is focusing heavily on protecting abortion rights in his run to succeed Representative Elissa Slotkin, who vacated this competitive Lansing-based seat to run for Senate. Tom Barrett, the Republican, lost to Slotkin in 2022 and is betting he can prevail this time without an abortion referendum on the ballot or an incumbent in the seat.
|Mich. 8||open|
D +10.3
| |
With the retirement of Representative Dan Kildee, Democrats face a tough battle to hold this swing district in central Michigan. Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet has stressed that she would protect abortion rights, while Republican Paul Junge has emphasized a crackdown on the border. Mr. Junge has previously made two unsuccessful runs for Congress.
|Neb. 2||Bacon|
R +2.7
| |
Representative Don Bacon, a Republican, is facing a rematch challenge from Democrat Tony Vargas, a state senator, whom he beat by just 6,000 votes in 2022, to represent Omaha and the surrounding suburbs ⎯ a swing district in an otherwise solidly red state. Mr. Bacon, a retired Air Force general, is considered a moderate, but Mr. Vargas has attacked him for his conservative stances, such as opposing abortion rights.
|N.M. 2||Vasquez|
D +0.7
| |
First-term Representative Gabe Vasquez, a Democrat, is in a rematch against former Representative Yvette Herrell, a Republican and former member of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus whom he defeated in 2022 by fewer than 1,300 votes. Mr. Vasquez has focused his campaign in the swing district on the U.S.-Mexico border on protecting abortion access and reproductive rights, while Ms. Herrell has centered hers around border security and immigration.
|N.Y. 4||D'Esposito|
R ⎯
| |
Representative Anthony D’Esposito helped Republicans flip the House in 2022. Now, he is one of its most vulnerable members, defending a left-leaning Long Island seat amid questions about reporting that he put his lover on the payroll. He faces Democrat Laura Gillen.
|N.Y. 19||Molinaro|
R ⎯
| |
In a closely watched rematch of 2022, the Republican incumbent, Marc Molinaro, takes on Josh Riley. Mr. Molinaro, known as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress, has veered to the right this cycle, leaning on fears about immigration.
|N.C. 1||Davis|
D ⎯
| |
Freshman Representative Don Davis, a Democrat, Air Force veteran and former college professor who frequently breaks with his party, faces a challenge from Republican Laurie Buckhout, a Trump-endorsed retired Army colonel and defense consultant from Virginia, in the sole competitive House race in the state.
|Ore. 5||Chavez-DeRemer|
R +2.1
| |
First-term Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a mainstream Republican who has endorsed former President Donald J. Trump, is running against Democrat Janelle Bynum, a state representative, in a district that stretches from Portland’s southern suburbs to the rapidly growing town of Bend. Both candidates are pitching themselves as independent thinkers who can work across party lines.
|Pa. 7||Wild|
D +2.0
| |
Democratic Representative Susan Wild, who has held this competitive seat since 2018, has vastly outraised her Republican challenger as she seeks a fourth term. But the district is favorable ground for Republicans, and Republican Ryan Mackenzie, a member of the state legislature, is running on an “America First” message associated with former President Donald J. Trump.
|Pa. 8||Cartwright|
D +2.4
| |
Representative Matt Cartwright, a Democrat, has represented the Scranton-area for more than a decade, but it remains one of the true swing districts in the country. An Erie native, Mr. Cartwright is the only member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to carry a district won by former President Donald J. Trump. He faces Rob Bresnahan Jr., whom Republicans believe has a solid chance to capture the seat.
|Pa. 10||Perry|
R +7.7
| |
Republican Representative Scott Perry, the former chairman of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus who played a lead role in seeking to overturn the 2020 election, is fighting to defend his seat in a central Pennsylvania district that has shifted toward the center. He faces Janelle Stelson, a popular TV anchor in the area who last year changed her party affiliation from Republican to Democrat and is running as a centrist.
|Va. 7||open|
D +4.7
| |
Democrat Yevgeny Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and lawyer who teamed with his twin brother in a whistleblower account that became the basis of the first impeachment case against President Donald J. Trump, is making his first foray into politics seeking to succeed retiring Representative Abigail Spanberger. He faces Derrick Anderson, a Republican and former Green Beret.
|Wash. 3||Gluesenkamp Perez|
D +0.8
| |
Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a first-term Democrat representing a rural, working class district that former President Donald J. Trump won twice, is considered the most vulnerable Democrat in the House. She has frequently broken with her party on major votes and is in a rematch against Joe Kent, a far-right election denier whom she beat in 2022 by less than 1 percentage point.

Election 2024 Polls: Harris vs. Trump
Election 2024 Polls: Harris vs. Trump
Both Trump and Harris have states they can probably count on to get at least 200 electoral votes, but they need to get to 270 to win. Let’s zoom in on seven key states in the middle where the vote was closest in 2020.
Harris 241
Trump 281
If the polls miss in Harris’s favor
Harris could easily prevail if the polls are underestimating her. A shift or polling miss in her favor would not be uncommon, though of course that is not guaranteed. Here’s a possible scenario.
Harris 273
Trump 265
If the polls miss in Trump’s favor
Trump could win by a larger electoral college margin if the polls are underestimating him even slightly. Here’s one possibility.
Harris 226
Trump 312
Across the seven swing states that are likely to decide the outcome of this election, the polls are so remarkably close that neither candidate has a meaningful edge in this final stretch. But if the polls are off even by a small margin, it’s possible either candidate could sweep most or all of these states. You can explore all possible scenarios and see the potential paths to victory here. Updated Oct. 23
States are shown in order of the closest current polling averages.
Swing states
|Election Results|
|Polling Leader||2020||2016|
|6 E.V.||Even||D +2||D +2|
|10 E.V.||Even||D +1||R +1|
|16 E.V.||Trump <1||R +1||R +4|
|15 E.V.||Harris <1||D +3||R <1|
|19 E.V.||Trump +1||D +1||R +1|
|16 E.V.||Trump +2||D <1||R +5|
|11 E.V.||Trump +3||D <1||R +4|
With the polls extremely close, tiny shifts in the averages are not significant in determining who is leading in a state. So we’ve made an adjustment: When the polling average margin is within a half a percentage point, the label will show “Even,” rather than showing that one candidate or the other is ahead. Updated Oct. 28
It’s normal for polls not to match the final results, sometimes by considerable amounts. The ranges in this chart represent the magnitude of each state’s biggest polling miss in recent elections, shown in relation to the current polling averages.
|Biggest recent |
polling miss
|Mich.||6 pts. (2022)|| |
Range of polling miss
|Wis.||9 pts. (2020)|
|Nev.||4 pts. (2012)|
|N.C.||6 pts. (2016)|
|Pa.||5 pts. (2022)|
|Ga.||2 pts. (2016)|
|Ariz.||3 pts. (2022)|
In 2016 and 2020, the polls underestimated Trump. But in 2012 they underestimated the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and in 2022 Democrats outperformed polling averages in several key midterm races. Past polling misses can give a sense of the magnitude by which current averages could be wrong, but they are not a guarantee of which way today’s polls may be off.
Every poll here influences the averages above. Polls from “select pollsters,” which meet certain criteria for reliability, count for more and are shown with a diamond. You can filter by state and toggle to show only select pollsters.
|Loading...|
In recent state polling, Marist showed a close race in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona — ranging from a tied race in Georgia to a two-point Trump lead in North Carolina. In each of the three, the polls were close to the Times average and similar to the prior Marist polls of the same state. The latest polls in the Northern battlegrounds stayed close as well. Quinnipiac found the race tied in Wisconsin, with Harris ahead by four points in Michigan. Importantly, the two results were quite a bit better for her than the last Quinnipiac poll, which showed Trump ahead in both states. Updated Oct. 28
Arrows to the left indicate polling gains for Harris; to the right, for Trump.
|Current |
margin
|polls|
|U.S.||Harris <1||39|
|Mich.||Harris <1||14|
|Wis.||Even||10|
|Nev.||Even||7|
|N.C.||Trump <1||9|
|Pa.||Trump +1||12|
|Ga.||Trump +2||5|
|Ariz.||Trump +3||9|
Why has Harris stayed resilient in the battlegrounds even as her national lead has narrowed? One possibility is that she hasn’t. There were a lot of high-quality national polls last week from many different pollsters, but there weren’t many state polls. We expect many pollsters’ final state polls over the final stretch; perhaps they will belatedly show a shift toward Trump. Another possibility is that her resilience is the result of the intense campaign in the battlegrounds. Millions of dollars are being spent on advertisements there as the candidates barnstorm this small group of states. And there’s a final possibility: One set of polls — the national polls or the state polls — could simply be more accurate than the other. Updated Oct. 28
This chart shows how the polling margin has changed over the course of the campaign, first for the Biden vs. Trump matchup, and now for Harris vs. Trump.
Nationwide, Harris now has her smallest lead in our average since the Democratic convention. Most of the major national polls have showed a shift toward Trump since their prior surveys. The size of his gains shouldn’t be overstated — we’re talking about a point or so — but it has nonetheless been enough to make the race more or less truly tied. Whatever edge Harris might have had has vanished. Updated Oct. 23

Tracking the Swing States for Harris and Trump
The presidential race will most likely come down to voters in eight competitive states, according to ratings by the Cook Political Report, which have held steady since late August.
There are many combinations of states that could put either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump over the threshold of the 270 electoral votes needed to win.
If both candidates win all of the states in their solid, likely and lean categories, the race would come down to the seven tossup states in yellow. Ms. Harris would need 44 electoral votes from the tossup states to win. Mr. Trump would need 51.
Six of the seven states rated as tossups were won narrowly by Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020. Of course, some of the states currently rated as leaning or likely Democratic or Republican could also come into play.

Tracking the Senate’s Most Competitive Races
Thirty-four Senate seats are up for election in November, but the balance of power in the chamber will likely be decided by nine of the most competitive races, according to the most recent ratings by the Cook Political Report. Currently Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, with four independent senators caucusing with the party.
Democrats and those who caucus with them currently sit in seven of the nine most competitive seats, including the Montana Senate seat, which is rated as Lean Republican. They would need to win seven of these seats to achieve an even partisan split in the Senate, with tie-breaking votes coming from the new vice president.

The fight is on to replace Senator Debbie Stabenow, a retiring Democrat. Mike Rogers, a mainstream Republican and former critic of Mr. Trump who later embraced him and won his endorsement, is facing Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who has used her national security credentials to win over swing voters in Central Michigan since 2018. Her trick will be to keep those centrist voters and energize more liberal voters in and around Detroit.

Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat in a solidly Republican state, has established an image as a stalwart supporter of working-class voters. Mr. Brown, the powerful chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has also amassed a considerable war chest. Bernie Moreno, his opponent, was not the Ohio G.O.P. establishment’s choice. Instead, he was Mr. Trump’s pick. A wealthy Colombian-born businessman, Mr. Moreno's sizable fortune helped him seed fund-raising.

Senator Jon Tester has defied the odds before, but his victories in 2006, 2012 and 2018 all came in strong Democratic cycles. His fight for a fourth Senate term will be considerably tougher, and he will need many ticket-splitters in a state that Mr. Trump won by 16 points in 2020. The Republican candidate, Tim Sheehy, is a decorated former Navy SEAL with the wealth to self-finance his campaign, as well as Mr. Trump’s backing.

|Texas|| |
Allred D
Cruz R Incumbent
R +5.6
| |
This is one of just two races in which Democrats hope to play offense. Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican seeking his third term, has never been personally popular in his state, but Texas has been reliably Republican for decades. Democrats looking for a long-shot Senate pickup have turned to Representative Colin Allred, who is giving up his Dallas-area House seat to challenge Mr. Cruz.

Maryland, which is reliably blue, should not be in play. But this race is one to watch because Larry Hogan, the moderate former Republican governor, has decided to run for the Senate seat of Ben Cardin, a Democrat who is retiring. Democrats nominated Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County Executive who is a former state’s attorney.
Likely Republican

Another rare contest where the Democratic candidate is on offense. Senator Rick Scott, a wealthy fixture of Florida politics who served for eight years as governor, has the high ground in seeking his second term. Democrats like their candidate, former Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who served one term in the House after the 2018 blue wave, but it would likely take severe erosion of Mr. Trump’s support to put this seat in play.

Where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Stand on Abortion
“The most important election of our lifetimes” is a political cliché, but the 2024 presidential election is certainly one of them. Across a wide array of issues affecting Americans’ daily lives and the shape of the country’s political system, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump have sharply different records and plans.
Here is what Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump have done and want to do on some of the most pressing issues, starting with abortion, climate, crime, democracy, the economy, education, foreign policy, health care, immigration, Israel and Gaza and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
Abortion
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris supports a federal right to abortion and wants to prevent states from banning the procedure before fetal viability. She has regularly spoken out in favor of abortion rights, including making the first official visit to an abortion clinic by a president or a vice president.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court appointees enabled the overturning of Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion. He has said that he would not sign a federal abortion ban but that states should be allowed to enact any restrictions they choose.
Roe v. Wade
Ms. Harris wants to enshrine the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law now that the Supreme Court has overturned it.
“When I am president of the United States, I will sign a law restoring and protecting reproductive freedom in every state,” she wrote in July. To do that, she would need not just Democratic majorities in Congress but also 50 senators willing to get rid of the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation. She confirmed in September that she supported eliminating the filibuster to pass an abortion rights bill.
Ms. Harris said last year that she and President Biden envisioned a law mirroring Roe. As modified by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Roe broadly protected the right to abortion until a fetus could survive outside the womb but allowed bans after that point so long as they had exceptions for medical emergencies. “We’re not trying to do anything that did not exist before June of last year,” she told CBS News.
She told NBC News in October that she did not support “concessions” within an abortion-rights bill to win Republican support. “I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,” she said.
As a senator, she was a sponsor of a bill called the Women’s Health Protection Act that would have gone somewhat further than Roe by prohibiting some state-level restrictions, such as requiring doctors to perform specific tests or to have hospital admitting privileges in order to provide abortions. She reiterated her support for it in 2022.
She also argued, while running for president in 2019, that states with a history of restricting abortion rights in violation of Roe should be subject to “pre-clearance” for new abortion laws, meaning those laws would have to be federally approved before they could take effect. Her campaign did not respond to a request to confirm whether she would still support this if Congress codified Roe. (Without such codification, the proposal is moot.)
In the absence of congressional majorities capable of codifying Roe, Mr. Biden’s cabinet took administrative actions to try to limit the effects of state abortion bans, and Ms. Harris has indicated support for those actions.
The Department of Health and Human Services told hospitals in 2022 that a law pertaining to emergency rooms, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, obligates doctors to perform an abortion if they believe it is needed to stabilize a patient. (That guidance is subject to legal challenges on which the Supreme Court has so far declined to rule.) In April, the same department announced a rule to shield many abortion patients’ medical records from investigators and prosecutors.
Mr. Trump has said that he believes abortion rights are a state issue. If elected again, he would allow states to restrict abortion as they see fit, including potential monitoring of pregnancies or criminal charges for abortion patients, he told Time magazine.
“It’s irrelevant whether I’m comfortable or not,” he said. “It’s totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.”
Mr. Trump appointed Justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Their votes were critical to overturning Roe v. Wade.
He has boasted about that fact on a number of occasions, saying he accomplished what no Republican president before him could and calling himself “proudly the person responsible” for the overturning of Roe. He has repeatedly, falsely, claimed that “all legal scholars” supported overturning it.
“After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the ‘shock’ of everyone, and for the first time put the pro life movement in a strong negotiating position,” he wrote on social media last year, adding, “Without me there would be no 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to.”
Federal Ban
Ms. Harris opposes a federal abortion ban and has said she would veto it if Congress passed one.
Mr. Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban. But in his debate with Ms. Harris in September, he did not commit to vetoing a ban if Congress passed one, and he rejected a statement from his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, that he had committed to doing so. Then he reversed again in October, saying “everyone knows” he would veto a ban.
He has long made contradictory statements on the matter, suggesting as recently as March that he might support some version of a federal ban. (In his first term, he endorsed a ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy.) In a Time magazine interview published in April, he deflected when asked whether he would veto a bill that defined life as beginning at fertilization.
Mr. Vance also sought in the vice-presidential debate in October to distinguish between a federal abortion ban and a “minimum national standard,” meaning a ban after a certain number of weeks. Asked whether Mr. Trump drew that distinction, a campaign spokeswoman said, “President Trump has been very clear: He will not support a federal ban on abortion.”
The campaign did not give a yes-or-no answer when asked if he would support enforcing the Comstock Act, an 1873 law that prohibits mailing materials used in abortions, and that some Trump allies want him to use to restrict abortion nationally without a formal ban. “President Trump has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion,” a spokeswoman said.
In August, when asked the same question about enforcing the Comstock Act, he told CBS News, “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no, I wouldn’t.”
He has framed his caution around abortion as a political matter because “you have to win elections.”
In Vitro Fertilization
Ms. Harris supports access to in vitro fertilization — a fertility treatment that can be threatened by anti-abortion measures that treat embryos as people with legal rights, since it usually involves creating numerous embryos and destroying or indefinitely freezing unused ones.
The matter gained urgency after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos were children, upending I.V.F. in the state. Ms. Harris condemned the ruling. (The Alabama Legislature subsequently passed a law that gave I.V.F. clinics immunity but did not address embryos’ legal status.)
“Individuals, couples who want to start a family are now being deprived of access to what can help them start a family,” she said at an event in Michigan in February.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, Mr. Trump said he supported access to I.V.F. because “we want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder.” However, he has not endorsed currently proposed legislation that would protect it.
In August, he suggested that he would support a federal mandate that insurance companies cover I.V.F. He did not give any details on how this proposal would work.
Medication Abortion
Ms. Harris supports access to mifepristone, an abortion drug that conservative litigants and Republican legislators have sought to restrict since the overturning of Roe. Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are medically induced with a regimen that includes mifepristone.
The Biden-Harris administration has defended mifepristone. Its solicitor general successfully urged the Supreme Court to reject a lawsuit that had sought to sharply limit access to the drug. The court unanimously upheld access in June, ruling that the plaintiffs in the suit did not have standing; anti-abortion activists are trying again with different plaintiffs.
In an effort to blunt the effects of state abortion bans, the Department of Health and Human Services advised pharmacists that they might violate civil rights laws if they refused to dispense drugs like mifepristone, misoprostol and methotrexate that can be used for abortions but also other medical purposes; Ms. Harris has indicated that she supports this guidance.
The Justice Department also issued a legal opinion that the Postal Service could deliver abortion drugs to states with bans without violating the Comstock Act, an 1873 law that prohibits mailing materials used in abortions. Abortion opponents have expressed interest in enforcing a strict interpretation of that law, which Ms. Harris’s campaign has condemned.
Mr. Trump appointed the federal judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, whose ruling last year voided the F.D.A.’s approval of mifepristone. An appeals court panel that was composed mainly of Trump appointees allowed it to stay on the market but upheld other parts of Judge Kacsmaryk’s ruling that made the drug harder to obtain.
In June, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the challenge to mifepristone, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the suit; anti-abortion activists are trying again with different plaintiffs.
Mr. Trump said during the presidential debate in June that he agreed with the Supreme Court’s ruling, which he described as having “approved the abortion pill.” But because it was based on standing, the ruling did not address the merits of the case.
His campaign did not respond to requests to confirm whether he would support rescinding F.D.A. approval for abortion pills.
Money and Abortion
Ms. Harris supported Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the global and domestic “gag rules,” which abortion opponents had used to cut off funding for groups that provide abortion services or referrals. When they were in effect under Mr. Trump, the rules blocked such groups from receiving foreign aid or domestic funding from Title X, a federal grant program that supports family planning for low-income Americans.
Versions of the global rule blocking certain foreign aid, called the Mexico City policy, have been enacted by every Republican president and rescinded by every Democratic one since the 1980s. Mr. Trump enacted the domestic rule for the first time since the Reagan administration.
Ms. Harris also opposes the Hyde Amendment, which bans Medicaid funding for most abortions. Her campaign did not confirm whether its inclusion in budgets would be a deal breaker for her; Mr. Biden also opposes the amendment but has signed budgets that include it rather than force a standoff with congressional Republicans over funding the government.
When he took office in 2017, Mr. Trump reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy, which blocked certain forms of foreign aid to organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals.
Republican presidents have routinely done that, but Mr. Trump went further: He extended the policy to block the organizations from receiving not only family-planning funding but also broader health aid, including money for clean water, nutrition programs and H.I.V., malaria and tuberculosis prevention.
He placed similar restrictions on Title X funding for domestic organizations for the first time since the Reagan administration.
Mr. Trump supported an unsuccessful Senate effort to make permanent the Hyde Amendment, which bans Medicaid funding for most abortions.
Climate
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris supports the Biden administration’s general approach to climate policies, including subsidies for renewable energy. She has promoted environmental justice programs, which focus on the impact of climate change on marginalized communities.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump denies established climate science, disparages renewable energy and champions unlimited production of fossil fuels. His administration rolled back more than 100 environmental protection regulations, and he plans a similar agenda if elected again.
Regulations
Ms. Harris has broadly supported the Biden administration’s environmental policies, but her campaign did not respond to a request to confirm her positions on individual regulations that the administration has put in place and that Mr. Trump says he would undo.
Those regulations include new Environmental Protection Agency rules that are designed to encourage electric and hybrid vehicles to account for a majority of newly sold cars by 2032. They are not a mandate, but the E.P.A. used its authority under the Clean Air Act to set limits on emissions that automakers could meet by making more electric vehicles. Ms. Harris’s campaign said in August that she did not support an electric vehicle mandate.
Another Biden rule says coal plants must eliminate about 90 percent of their emissions by 2039 or shut down. A third requires oil and gas producers to fix leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas; the administration also announced a fee on methane emissions.
Ms. Harris has not confirmed any additional environmental regulations she would enact. During her first presidential campaign in 2019, she called for a tax on carbon emissions, but she has not said whether she still supports that.
As president, Mr. Trump rolled back more than 100 environmental regulations, including many aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions and protecting clean air and water.
He has pledged to rescind “every one” of the Biden administration’s electricity regulations and to end its rules promoting electric vehicles. In April, he promised oil executives and lobbyists directly that he would reverse regulations that hurt their businesses.
Among the rules he ended or replaced in his term were some enacted by President Barack Obama that had limited emissions from power plants and from cars and trucks. He did away with a requirement that state and regional officials track tailpipe emissions on federal highways; with methane emission standards; with reporting requirements for oil and gas companies; and with regulations meant to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons.
He also directed agencies to stop calculating the “social cost” of carbon, which they had done under the Obama administration to estimate the long-term economic benefits of reducing emissions. He revoked California’s authority to set its own, stricter standards for vehicle emissions, and he said in October that if elected again, he would not allow any state to ban gas-powered vehicles.
Renewable Energy
Ms. Harris cast the tiebreaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided the largest-ever federal investment in climate change mitigation — largely through tax credits that helped manufacturers increase production of electric vehicles as well as wind, solar and other renewable power projects. It also provided rebates to help consumers buy clean-energy products.
She also supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill Mr. Biden signed (which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging equipment) and the CHIPS and Science Act (which provided $39 billion in incentives to manufacture semiconductors used in electric vehicles, among other applications).
Her campaign has indicated that continuing to implement these laws and distribute their funding would be a priority for her administration, but it has not specified additional steps she would take to encourage renewable energy development.
It also has not confirmed whether she still supports the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution of which she was a sponsor as a senator. It calls for the United States to reach 100 percent clean energy within a decade and describes clean air and water as basic human rights.
Mr. Trump wants to roll back the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy and electric-vehicle incentives. Eliminating them would require congressional action, but his administration would have significant power over how to implement the tax breaks created by the law, and it could make them harder to get.
At the Republican National Convention, referring to funding allocated for climate programs but not yet spent, he said, “We will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams, and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New Scam ideas.” (Presidents are obligated to spend money as Congress allocates it, but Mr. Trump has suggested he would try to claim the authority not to. His administration could also slow disbursements or narrow eligibility rules.)
He has repeatedly attacked and spread misinformation about renewable energy, including statements claiming falsely that wind turbines cause cancer and are “driving whales crazy” and that relying on solar power would leave older Americans without air-conditioning.
His administration favored oil and gas development over renewable-energy development in its regulatory and permitting decisions, and he said at a rally in May that, if elected again, he would end offshore wind projects by executive order on his first day back in office.
The one carbon-free option he has praised is nuclear energy. David Bernhardt, who served as secretary of the interior under Mr. Trump, said on a campaign call in August that Mr. Trump supports nuclear energy production.
Fossil Fuels
During her first presidential campaign in 2019, Ms. Harris endorsed a ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process used to extract oil and natural gas from bedrock. She also challenged federal approvals of offshore fracking when she was attorney general of California. However, she says she no longer supports a fracking ban.
“My values have not changed — I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate,” she told CNN in August. Pointing to the Inflation Reduction Act, she said she had concluded since 2019 that “we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.”
In the debate in September, she said she supported investing in “diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil” and noted approvingly that U.S. oil production reached record levels under the Biden administration.
Her campaign did not respond when asked whether her approach to oil and gas permitting would differ from Mr. Biden’s. His record has been inconsistent: He allowed several projects that environmental groups opposed, but he also banned drilling in large parts of Alaska and paused permitting for new liquefied natural gas export facilities.
Mr. Trump has called for unlimited oil and gas drilling, pledging to “end Biden’s delays in federal drilling permits and leases” and “remove all red tape that is leaving oil and natural gas projects stranded.” He has also called for building more coal plants and eliminating a Biden regulation that would force many existing plants to close.
In his first term, his administration approved the Keystone pipeline — which the Obama administration had blocked — and expedited the Dakota Access pipeline. (A federal judge later ruled that his administration had not sufficiently assessed the Dakota project’s environmental impact.) Soon after that, he issued an executive order to expand offshore drilling.
He weakened the National Environmental Policy Act to limit public review of federal infrastructure projects, including fossil-fuel developments like pipelines and power plants; reduced protections for wetlands and endangered species, enabling oil and gas development in locations and circumstances where it would previously have been barred; and allowed oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
He says if elected again, he would end the Biden administration’s pause on permits for new liquefied natural gas export facilities.
Adaptation
Ms. Harris has embraced a framework known as environmental justice, which emphasizes that climate change and pollution disproportionately affect low-income people and people of color and argues that environmental programs should focus on those communities.
In 2019, Ms. Harris, then a senator, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced legislation that would have evaluated environmental rules and laws by how they affected low-income communities. In 2020, Ms. Harris introduced a more sweeping version of that bill. She also sponsored the National Climate Bank Act, which would have created a national bank to, among other things, help low-income Americans “benefit from and afford projects and investments that reduce emissions.” (None of these bills passed.)
The Inflation Reduction Act, which Ms. Harris supports, and the bipartisan infrastructure law include billions of dollars in funding to reduce the effects of drought, help low-income Americans weatherize their homes and strengthen electric grids on Native American reservations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency also received funding from the infrastructure law for a program focused on preparing communities for extreme weather.
Ms. Harris has also expressed support for the Labor Department’s proposed rules to protect workers during heat waves, including requirements that employers develop safety plans and provide breaks and access to water and shade.
Mr. Trump has not called for policies to help communities prepare for extreme-weather events such as droughts, wildfires and hurricanes that are becoming more frequent and intense because of climate change.
In both 2018 and 2020, he inaccurately blamed poor forest management, not climate change, for historically severe wildfires in California. “I said, ‘You’ve got to clean your floors, you got to clean your forests,’” he said in 2020. “Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us.”
In September, as wildfires raged again, he blamed California’s water management policies and threatened to withhold federal aid unless the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, agreed to divert water in the ways Mr. Trump called for. Two former officials said that when he was in office, he had opposed sending aid to California until aides showed him data on how many Republicans lived there.
His administration froze hiring at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, resulting in fewer inspections of workplaces for conditions including dangerous heat, and he reduced funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His campaign did not answer a question about his position on the Biden administration’s proposed rules establishing workplace safety standards for extreme heat.
Emission Reductions
Ms. Harris would keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement, which committed almost every country to try to limit global warming to no more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and which Mr. Biden rejoined after Mr. Trump had withdrawn.
The Biden administration has pledged to cut U.S. emissions at least 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Under the Paris agreement, nations are expected to announce targets for 2035 next year. Ms. Harris’s campaign did not say what targets she supported.
The actions Mr. Biden has taken, many but not all of which Ms. Harris has confirmed she supports, will get the country most of the way to the 2030 goal: The Inflation Reduction Act and his regulations on vehicles, power plants and oil wells are expected to lower emissions about 40 percent.
In withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, under which almost every country had committed to try to limit warming to no more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, Mr. Trump formally disavowed emission reductions as a goal. His campaign says he would withdraw from the Paris Agreement again if re-elected.
While Mr. Biden undid many of Mr. Trump’s climate policies, their damage may not be fully reversible.
A report in 2022 from researchers at Yale and Columbia found that the United States’ environmental performance had plummeted as a result of the Trump administration’s actions. A separate analysis in 2020 projected 1.8 billion more metric tons of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2035 than there would have been without his dismantling of regulations.
Crime
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris supports more funding for the police, a change from her first presidential campaign, during which she said adding officers wouldn’t make communities safer. She supported significant criminal justice reforms in 2019, but has not confirmed whether she still does. Restrictions on guns are a major component of her proposals for reducing crime.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump wants to deploy the military to Democratic-run cities — potentially by invoking the Insurrection Act — to combat what he describes as rampant crime, though F.B.I. statistics show that crime rates have dropped. He signed a criminal justice reform bill as president, but since then has called for harsher criminal penalties and less due process. He opposes gun restrictions.
Policing
Ms. Harris has pledged to “continue to invest in funding law enforcement, including the hiring and training of officers and people to support them,” and has praised the billions of dollars President Biden has approved for that purpose.
This differs from her position in 2020, after a police officer murdered George Floyd, when Ms. Harris said in multiple interviews that the United States needed to “reimagine” public safety and that more police officers would not create safer communities. She said then that she did not support abolishing police departments, but that more money should be devoted to services like education, health care and housing to address root causes of crime.
“We should be looking at our budgets and asking, ‘Are we getting the best return on investment as taxpayers,’ much less what is morally right,” she said on MSNBC in June 2020, arguing that police officers were not the right people to deal with problems stemming from homelessness, substance abuse or mental illness. “It is outdated, and it is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.”
That, in turn, was a shift from a stance she took in her 2009 book. “A more visible and strategic police presence is a deterrent to crime,” she wrote.
In 2020, she helped lead a push for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would have required use of force by police officers to be “necessary,” not just “reasonable”; limited no-knock warrants and chokeholds; lowered the bar for convicting officers of misconduct; limited qualified immunity, which shields officers from civil rights lawsuits; and increased reporting requirements for policing data. Her campaign didn’t confirm whether she still supported it.
And she supported a 2022 executive order in which Mr. Biden took some similar steps, including limiting transfers of military equipment to the police, restricting chokeholds and creating a national registry of officers fired for misconduct.
Mr. Trump has denounced calls to defund police departments. But he has also called for defunding the Justice Department and the F.B.I.; denounced officials investigating his actions, which have resulted in 34 felony convictions and three other indictments; and defended supporters who brutalized police officers at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
As president, he sent federal agents to Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., and other cities in response to spikes in violence, and he says he would do the same if elected again. He has vowed to deploy the National Guard without waiting for requests from local officials, part of a broader plan to deploy the military on U.S. soil — potentially by invoking the Insurrection Act to get around a prohibition on using the military for domestic law enforcement.
He says he would “strengthen” qualified immunity, which shields police officers from lawsuits alleging civil rights violations, and further “indemnify” officers from punishment, but his campaign did not provide details on what that would involve.
He has also said that he would approve Justice Department grants only to police departments that adopt “stop and frisk” policies — which disproportionately affect Black and Latino men — and that cities should return to “broken windows” policing, which holds that cracking down on low-level crimes can prevent serious ones.
As president, he rescinded an Obama-era executive order that limited transfers of surplus military equipment to police departments. Mr. Biden signed an executive order with a similar provision. Mr. Trump has not said whether he would repeal that one, too, but he praised such transfers in a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police in September.
He has urged the police to treat suspects more harshly and at times called for abandoning due process. In September, he suggested that “one really violent day” of unchecked police force could solve property crime, declaring: “One rough hour — and I mean real rough. The word will get out and it will end immediately.”
Last year, he said, “Very simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store.” That echoed what former Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper recalled as Mr. Trump’s response in 2020 after a minority of Black Lives Matter protests resulted in looting or violence: “Can’t you just shoot them?”
After the police murder of Mr. Floyd that year, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that encouraged but did not require departments to take steps like limiting chokeholds and strengthening training.
Guns
Ms. Harris wants to enact universal background checks; bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; and red-flag laws, which allow the removal of firearms from people whom a court deems to pose a threat to themselves or others.
She supported bipartisan legislation that Mr. Biden signed in 2022 to expand background checks for gun buyers under 21, provide funding for state red-flag laws and mental health programs, tighten laws against gun trafficking, and narrow a loophole that had exempted unmarried partners from a law that bars domestic abusers from buying guns.
When Ms. Harris first ran for president in 2019, she called for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons, meaning anybody who purchased one before her proposed ban took effect would have had to sell it to the government. However, her campaign says she no longer supports such buybacks.
She also called in 2019 for licensing and registration requirements for gun owners; for raising the minimum age and establishing a waiting period for purchases; and for opening gun manufacturers and sellers to civil liability, which federal law largely shields them from. She said she would use executive action to expand background checks, ban imports of assault weapons and “revoke the licenses of gun manufacturers and dealers that break the law.”
Her campaign did not confirm whether she still supported those measures. More so than in her first run, she has emphasized recently that she is a gun owner and supports the availability of firearms for self-defense.
Mr. Trump vowed this year to “roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment,” and to oppose any new gun restrictions.
His administration enacted one significant restriction, a ban on bump stocks — attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster — after a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. The Supreme Court overturned the bump stock ban this year, and Mr. Trump’s campaign said in response: “The court has spoken, and their decision should be respected. President Trump has been and always will be a fierce defender of Americans’ Second Amendment rights.”
After the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018, Mr. Trump briefly suggested that he would support universal background checks and red-flag laws, which allow the removal of firearms from people whom a court deems to pose a threat to themselves or others. “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” he said. But he quickly abandoned those proposals in the face of opposition from the National Rifle Association.
“During my four years, nothing happened, and there was great pressure on me having to do with guns,” he said in February. “We did nothing. We didn’t yield.”
Criminal Justice
When Ms. Harris ran for president in 2019, she described herself as a “progressive prosecutor” and proposed sweeping criminal justice reforms in a lengthy, detailed plan. Her campaign did not confirm whether she still supported the same proposals.
That plan called for eliminating cash bail, mandatory minimum sentences, private prisons and solitary confinement; ending sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine; legalizing marijuana; and creating incentives for states to shorten some probation sentences, to end jail time for technical parole violations and to direct most juvenile offenders into “restorative justice” programs.
It proposed financial incentives for prosecutors who reduced incarceration and recidivism, rather than those who obtained more convictions and longer sentences; more funding for public defenders; and a requirement that federal prisons provide education, vocational training, mental health care, addiction treatment and an informational course on re-entry support services.
It also called for restoring voting rights to felons once they completed their sentences; removing bans on access to public housing, student loans and other services for formerly incarcerated people; and limiting when employers can ask about applicants’ criminal records.
Some of these policies were shifts from what she backed a few years earlier. For example, she supported increasing cash bail for some crimes when she was the San Francisco district attorney and opposed a statewide police body-camera requirement when she was attorney general of California. As district attorney, she also promoted a law that allowed the prosecution of parents whose children frequently missed school, a policy she later said she regretted.
Mr. Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act, a turn away from “tough on crime” policies that had led to mass incarceration starting in the 1980s. Among other measures, it reduced some mandatory minimum sentences, expanded early-release programs and increased job training for former prisoners. He also supported restrictions on asking about criminal history in federal hiring.
His campaign said he had not changed his position on the First Step Act. However, his administration also took steps in the opposite direction.
For instance, in 2017, the Justice Department released guidelines directing federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges they believed they could “readily” prove, and requiring exceptions to be approved by a supervisor.
“By definition, the most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences,” a department memo said.
In 2020, Mr. Trump featured Alice Marie Johnson, a nonviolent drug offender whose sentence he had commuted, at the Republican National Convention. But he has since suggested that drug dealers should be executed. When the Fox News host Bret Baier noted that Ms. Johnson would have been executed under this policy, Mr. Trump said: “She wouldn’t be killed. It would start as of now.”
Death Penalty
Ms. Harris has long opposed the death penalty, dating back to her campaign for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. She pledged never to seek the death penalty as district attorney, and she didn’t, even against a man charged with killing a police officer.
She took a less definitive position in her campaign for attorney general of California in 2010, saying she would “enforce the death penalty as the law dictates.” As attorney general, she defended the state’s capital punishment program in court; she described doing so as a professional obligation and not as a change in her personal position.
As a presidential candidate in 2019, she reiterated her opposition to capital punishment, criticizing it as “immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and proven to be unequally applied” and calling for the abolition of the federal death penalty. She defended her record in a debate that year, saying: “My entire career, I have been opposed, personally opposed, to the death penalty, and that has never changed. And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision to face the people I have faced and to say, ‘I will not seek the death penalty.’”
The Biden administration has not executed anyone, but it is seeking to do so in one case and has not sought to abolish the federal death penalty. Ms. Harris’s campaign did not confirm whether she still wanted to abolish it.
Mr. Trump supports the death penalty and has called for expanding it to drug dealers and human traffickers.
He has also called for reducing due process, urging Congress “to ensure that anyone caught trafficking children across our border receives the death penalty immediately” and praising China’s use of “quick” trials to sentence people to death for drug crimes.
As president, he ended a moratorium on federal executions, allowing the first federal execution in 17 years. His administration put to death in six months more than four times as many people as had been executed in nearly the previous 60 years.
Marijuana Laws
Ms. Harris has called for decriminalizing marijuana. “Nobody should have to go to jail for smoking weed,” she wrote on April 20. “We must continue to change our nation’s approach to marijuana while reforming the justice system so it finally lives up to its name.”
She supports the Biden administration’s steps to remove marijuana from the Schedule I regulation category, which designates it alongside drugs like heroin as having no accepted medical purpose. She also supported Mr. Biden’s sweeping pardons for marijuana use and possession. (Those pardons did not apply to charges of selling or driving under the influence.)
Earlier in her career, Ms. Harris opposed legalizing marijuana for recreational use, and as district attorney of San Francisco she prosecuted many people for marijuana-related crimes. She changed her stance when she became a senator and was a co-sponsor of a bill that would have legalized marijuana.
Mr. Trump’s administration took steps against allowing marijuana use, including reversing an Obama-era policy that had protected states that legalized marijuana from federal crackdowns.
However, he recently said that he supported reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule III drug, which could open the door for medical use. (It is currently Schedule I, the same category as heroin.) He also endorsed a constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize recreational marijuana, but his campaign declined to say whether he wanted to do that federally.
Democracy
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris’s campaign has framed the election in part as a fight to preserve American democracy. She has condemned Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and she supports legislation to expand voting access and counter restrictions in Republican-led states.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump is the only U.S. president who has refused to accept his loss. He tried to overturn the 2020 election and has sought to delegitimize the electoral system. He has used dehumanizing terms like “vermin” to describe his political opponents.
Transfer of Power
Ms. Harris has committed to accepting the results of the 2024 election and denounced Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the last one.
In accepting the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August, she said she would “hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power.” Earlier this year, she met with voting rights activists and described a strategy that included creating a task force on threats to election workers.
As the current vice president, whether she wins or loses in November, Ms. Harris will preside over the certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2025. Her campaign told Politico in July that she would not use her position to intervene in the counting.
That is in line with reforms Mr. Biden signed to the Electoral Count Act in an effort to prevent a repeat of Mr. Trump’s attempt to exploit the Jan. 6 proceedings to overturn his loss. The legislation established that the vice president’s role is ceremonial and increased the number of lawmakers required to object to counting a state’s electoral votes.
Mr. Trump has refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results and has not dismissed the possibility of political violence if he loses.
“I think we’re going to win,” he said in an April interview with Time. “And if we don’t win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election.”
He refused to accept his defeat in 2020, after which he and his allies attempted an extraordinary scheme to subvert voters’ will: They pressured legislators to declare him the winner of states he had lost; organized slates of fake Electoral College electors; pushed Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the results; and agitated his supporters, who threatened election officials and stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Two of the four criminal indictments against him, one federal and one in Georgia, are related to those actions.
He has continued to promote the same lies since then. In 2022, he suggested the “termination” of the Constitution in order to overturn or rerun the election.
He has also embraced people charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, calling them “patriots” and “hostages,” and has indicated on several occasions that he would pardon them if elected again.
Mr. Trump has been pushing his supporters for a turnout this fall that is “too big to rig,” pre-emptively sowing doubt about the validity of the election, as he did in 2016 and 2020.
Voting Rights
Ms. Harris supports two pieces of legislation — which Mr. Biden also supported, but was unable to pass because of Republican filibusters — to counter voting restrictions that have been passed in many Republican-led states. She helped push for both bills when they were first introduced, having been assigned to lead the Biden administration’s efforts to secure voting rights legislation after she requested that job.
The first is the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore sections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the Supreme Court has struck down or weakened. The second is the Freedom to Vote Act, which would set a floor for voting access in federal elections, meaning states could enact more inclusive procedures but not less inclusive ones.
Among other things, the Freedom to Vote Act would expand automatic voter registration programs, let all voters register online and on Election Day, require at least 15 days of early voting and restore voting rights to felons upon their release from prison.
It would also restrict partisan gerrymandering, allow voters to sue if election officials refused to certify results and establish a nationwide voter identification requirement. The ID requirement would accept a wider range of documents (like utility bills) than many existing state laws allow.
Mr. Trump has frequently attacked mail voting and spread unfounded conspiracy theories about the security of voting machines.
His words have fueled a decline in public confidence in the well-documented integrity of the electoral system that many Republican state legislators have used to justify new restrictions on voting. Mr. Trump has largely endorsed those restrictions and has often called for a national voter identification requirement.
He has sent mixed messages on early voting. Facing evidence that discouraging it could hurt Republican turnout, he told supporters on social media in April, “Absentee voting, early voting and Election Day voting are all good options.” But he has also repeatedly called for single-day elections — which would mean eliminating early voting — conducted exclusively with paper ballots.
Mr. Trump opposed the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act when Democrats tried to pass them in 2021. “They have a so-called voting rights bill, which is a voting rights for Democrats, because Republicans will never be elected again if that happens,” he told Fox Business.
As president, he established a commission to investigate voter fraud after falsely claiming that undocumented immigrants and votes cast in the names of dead people had caused him to lose the popular vote in 2016. The commission found no evidence of widespread fraud, and Mr. Trump disbanded it.
Executive Power
Ms. Harris has condemned Mr. Trump’s statements that he might intervene in Justice Department prosecution decisions, describing the department’s independence as essential. And she has said the Biden administration has always respected that independence.
“There is a clear and nonnegotiable division in terms of the separation between our administration and what the Department of Justice does, in terms of its investigations, in terms of its prosecutions,” she told CNN this year in an exchange about the department’s investigations of Mr. Trump. “And that line has never been crossed.”
Her campaign did not respond when asked whether she agreed with the Justice Department’s assessment that presidents can order “limited” military actions without congressional approval. (Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump have done that.)
When Ms. Harris was asked a similar question during her 2019 presidential campaign, she said: “I won’t hesitate to do what it takes to protect our country in the face of an imminent threat in the future. But after almost two decades of war, it is long past time for Congress to rewrite the Authorization for Use of Military Force that governs our current military conflicts.”
She answered several other questions about executive power in a New York Times survey during her 2019 campaign.
Mr. Trump has indicated that he would end the norm of Justice Department independence, openly vowing to use the levers of government to punish his political opponents — as he tried to do when he was in office — and anyone whom he deems to have engaged in “unscrupulous behavior” in this year’s election. He has also floated the idea of pardoning himself, something no president has ever tried to do.
He also said he would consider firing a U.S. attorney who declined to prosecute someone whom Mr. Trump wanted prosecuted, telling Time magazine, “It would depend on the situation.”
As president, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that sought to strip civil-service protections from many career federal employees, which would have let him fire them at will and purge federal agencies of people he disagreed with. In September, he vowed to fire civil servants who have carried out Biden administration policies. He and his allies have been planning a sweeping expansion of presidential power if he is re-elected.
At least twice, he authorized military force without congressional approval, something Mr. Biden has also done, in keeping with an assessment from the Justice Department.
Mr. Trump also used an emergency declaration to spend more money on border wall construction than Congress had appropriated, and then twice vetoed bills passed by Congress to end the emergency. Conversely, he wants the ability to refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated, something lawmakers banned decades ago.
Fox News’s Sean Hannity asked him in December whether he would pledge not to abuse presidential power. Mr. Trump replied: “This guy, he says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said, ‘No, no, no — other than Day 1.’ We’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.”
Economy
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris supports the Biden administration’s spending on infrastructure and renewable energy. She wants to ban price gouging, create incentives to build housing, expand tax credits for middle- and low-income households, and offset the costs by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump enacted a large package of tax cuts as president and pursued protectionist trade policies, including a trade war with China. He wants to cut taxes further and enact more sweeping tariffs. He says he would not cut Social Security or Medicare benefits but has not provided a plan to keep the programs solvent.
Inflation
Inflation skyrocketed early in the Biden-Harris administration, peaking at 9.1 percent in 2022. Since then, inflation has slowed while the job market and consumer spending have remained mostly strong, pointing to a potential “soft landing” in which inflation returns to normal without a recession. But the remnants of inflation have been stubborn.
Part of the cause was the Covid-19 pandemic, which raised prices around the world as supply-chain problems escalated. U.S. government stimulus money intended to stop the economy from crashing and support pandemic response programs — Mr. Trump approved more than $3 trillion in 2020 and Mr. Biden $1.9 trillion in 2021 — also fueled demand. Republicans have blamed Mr. Biden’s spending, and some economists have criticized the size and timing of his relief plan, but they have also credited it with preventing a recession.
Ms. Harris’s main proposal for reducing inflation is to ban corporate price gouging on groceries. Her campaign says she would authorize the Federal Trade Commission to impose “harsh penalties” on corporations that violated the ban, fund investigations of gouging in meat supply chains and scrutinize mergers of large grocery companies.
The Federal Reserve, which operates independently of the White House, plays a large role in responding to inflation by adjusting interest rates. When the Fed raises rates, it becomes more expensive to take out a mortgage or a business loan, creating a chain reaction that cools the economy. Ms. Harris said in August that she would “never interfere” in Fed decisions.
Inflation was low — generally around 2 percent — during Mr. Trump’s term, as it had been for years before.
He has argued without evidence that the United States would not have had high inflation if he had remained in office for a second term, though most nations did. He has indicated that he would not have spent the stimulus money Mr. Biden did in 2021, which many economists say was a factor in inflation, but he has said little about how he would have handled the other factors, like global supply chain problems, that drove inflation worldwide.
Economists say the agenda he has described for his second term is not likely to reduce inflation, and it includes policies like sweeping tariffs and deportations that could make it worse.
Mr. Trump has also criticized high interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s primary tool to control inflation. He argued in August that the president should have a say in the decisions of the Fed, which normally operates independently of the White House.
Spending
Ms. Harris has indicated that she supports Mr. Biden’s approach to federal spending and has praised two of the biggest pieces of legislation he signed: the Inflation Reduction Act, which included hundreds of billions of dollars in clean-energy tax credits and health insurance subsidies, and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal. These measures were aimed at driving job creation, which several studies and government employment statistics indicate they did.
Mr. Trump, like Mr. Biden, significantly increased discretionary spending, but for different purposes. Before the pandemic, his increases went mainly to the military and veterans’ care: In 2018, for example, he signed a military budget of $700 billion, a double-digit percentage increase from the year before.
Spending increased more significantly during the pandemic, with stimulus and other relief bills totaling over $3 trillion by the time Mr. Trump left office. Those bills sent two rounds of direct payments to Americans, created the Paycheck Protection Program to keep companies afloat, expanded unemployment benefits and provided funding for hospitals, vaccines and local governments.
Taxes
Ms. Harris has endorsed most of the tax proposals that Mr. Biden made in the spring, which would total nearly $5 trillion in increases for corporations and wealthy Americans but extend Trump-era cuts for people making less than $400,000 a year.
She wants to increase the top marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6 percent from 37 percent. She wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent, partly reversing a reduction that Mr. Trump signed.
She is also proposing increasing the corporate minimum tax to 21 percent from 15 percent. That minimum, established by the Inflation Reduction Act, is distinct from the regular corporate rate; it applies to companies that report more than $1 billion in income but had used deductions to pay little or no federal taxes.
Other proposals include a minimum tax of 25 percent for people with assets of more than $100 million, higher taxes on foreign profits and wider eligibility for the earned-income tax credit.
She wants to restore an expansion of the child tax credit — to a maximum of $3,600 per child — that reduced child poverty before it expired, bring the credit to $6,000 for parents of newborns and make it refundable, meaning poor families that don’t owe taxes could receive it. She has adopted a Trump proposal to eliminate taxes on tips. And she is proposing a $50,000 tax deduction for small-business start-ups.
She has broken from Mr. Biden on one point: She would raise the capital gains tax by significantly less than he had proposed, bringing it to 28 percent for Americans who make more than $1 million a year instead of Mr. Biden’s proposed 39.6 percent. (It is currently 20 percent.)
A study from a nonpartisan group, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, estimated that Ms. Harris’s tax and spending plans would add about half as much to the national debt as Mr. Trump’s plans would, but potentially still trillions of dollars.
Mr. Trump cut corporate taxes as part of a $1.5 trillion package in 2017, the most sweeping tax overhaul in decades. It permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and temporarily reduced tax rates for individuals, including the wealthiest Americans. It also doubled the maximum child tax credit to $2,000 per child.
Mr. Trump wants Congress to make permanent the individual cuts, which are set to expire in 2025, and further lower the corporate rate to 15 percent — though he acknowledged in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that this would be “hard” and suggested he might settle for 20 percent. His campaign did not answer a question about whether he would reduce or eliminate the corporate minimum tax, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act and is distinct from the regular corporate rate.
He has called for eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits and lowering them for Americans living abroad, without providing details on how these proposals would work or how he would deal with the lost revenue. His campaign said he would “consider” expanding the child tax credit, but did not commit or give details; his past policies on the credit extended it to high-income families but did not make it available to poor ones whose incomes are too low to owe taxes.
Though the 2017 tax package substantially cut taxes overall, in one respect it went in the other direction: It capped a deduction that let people save on their federal taxes based on how much they paid in state and local taxes. That cap mainly affected high earners in high-tax states like California and New York. Mr. Trump now says he wants to reverse the cap.
A study from a nonpartisan group, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, estimated that Mr. Trump’s tax and spending plans would add about twice as much to the national debt as Ms. Harris’s plans would.
Trade
Ms. Harris has rejected the across-the-board tariffs that Mr. Trump has proposed, saying at the Democratic National Convention that they would be tantamount to a “national sales tax.”
But her campaign has indicated that she would support some tariffs, without providing details. A campaign spokesman said in August that Ms. Harris would “employ targeted and strategic tariffs to support American workers, strengthen our economy and hold our adversaries accountable.”
The Biden administration has not rolled back Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products, and in April Mr. Biden announced that he would expand them, tripling some tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. In May, he went further, increasing tariffs on electric vehicles, solar cells, semiconductors and advanced batteries, and officially endorsing the Trump-era tariffs that he had criticized in 2020. Ms. Harris’s campaign did not say whether she would change or end any of these tariffs.
Mr. Trump jettisoned Republican free-trade orthodoxy and embraced protectionism, starting a trade war with China.
He set tariffs in 2018 on washing machines and solar-energy equipment, and later on steel and aluminum. The trade war with China began later that year when he imposed an escalating series of tariffs. China responded in kind. Other countries imposed their own retaliatory tariffs. American consumers, researchers found, bore the brunt of the costs.
Mr. Trump signed an initial trade deal with China in 2020, but the agreement preserved most of the tariffs.
He has suggested he would go further in a second term, imposing tariffs of 60 percent or more on Chinese products and 10 or 20 percent on other imports. In March, he said he supported a 100 percent tariff on cars made by Chinese companies in Mexico, and in May he one-upped himself to 200 percent.
Economists say tariffs of this scope would increase prices and could cause a recession.
In October, Mr. Trump suggested that, on the cars tariff, he was making up numbers as a threat to get countries to manufacture in the United States. “Until now I’ve said 200” percent, he told Fox News. “I’m using that just as a figure. I’ll say 100, 200, I’ll say 500, I don’t care.”
His other major trade policy was a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which critics said had encouraged outsourcing to Mexico. The new version, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, contains more protections for workers and provisions aimed primarily at encouraging auto manufacturing in the United States.
Regulations
The Biden administration has pushed for regulations that have a direct pocketbook effect: For instance, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is trying to cap credit card late fees, and the Transportation Department set a rule requiring automatic refunds when flights are canceled. Ms. Harris has endorsed a similar approach, saying at a rally in July that she would “ban hidden fees and surprise late charges” by banks and other companies.
She has called for raising the federal minimum wage and has indicated that she supports the Labor Department’s move to require employers to pay overtime starting next year to people earning up to $58,656 annually, up from the current threshold of $35,568.
She has also indicated that she supports stringent antitrust efforts, and her campaign says she would “direct her administration to crack down on anti-competitive practices.” Among other things, her proposal to ban price gouging calls for challenging mergers of supermarket companies, as the Biden administration is doing with Kroger and Albertsons.
The Trump administration reduced financial regulations, including some that were enacted after the 2008 housing crisis.
One of its most significant steps was weakening the Volcker Rule, which had blocked banks from making risky bets with customers’ money if the customers had not requested the bets. The loosened rule lets banks invest in certain funds that make such bets.
Under a leader appointed by Mr. Trump, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rescinded restrictions on payday loans. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also weakened a housing anti-discrimination rule so severely that banks took the unusual step of opposing a deregulatory move.
His administration weakened an Obama-era overtime rule, and while he said during his 2016 campaign that he would support raising the federal minimum wage, he did not pursue that once elected. In 2020, he said minimum wages should be left to the states.
He said in September that he would eliminate 10 regulations for every one he added.
Social Security and Medicare
Ms. Harris has pledged not to cut Social Security or Medicare benefits.
Projections fluctuate based on economic conditions, but estimates from this spring indicate that Social Security and its associated disability insurance program will run out of money to cover full benefits in 2035, and part of Medicare will do the same in 2036. To keep them solvent, Ms. Harris wants to raise taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year.
She has proposed increasing two Medicare surtaxes to 5 percent from 3.8 percent for people making over $400,000. She has been less specific about her plans for Social Security, and her campaign did not respond to a question about them, but she has indicated that she supports increases to Social Security taxes for wealthy Americans as well.
She supports the Inflation Reduction Act provision that let Medicare negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies for the first time, which could lower prices for consumers and save the program money. (The law also requires drug companies to make payments to Medicare if they increase their prices faster than inflation.) Her economic plan says she would “allow Medicare to accelerate the speed of negotiations.”
As a senator, Ms. Harris was a sponsor of the Social Security Expansion Act, which would have increased benefits. Her campaign did not confirm whether she still supports that.
Mr. Trump says he would not cut Social Security or Medicare benefits. But he also wants to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, which would cause the program to run out of money sooner.
He has not explained how he would keep the programs solvent without reducing benefits or increasing taxes. Projections fluctuate based on economic conditions, but estimates from this spring indicate that Social Security will run out of money to cover full benefits by 2035, and part of Medicare will do so by 2036.
When he was asked on Fox Business in August about his tax plan moving up that date, he said that might be a good thing because it would pressure Congress to “make a deal.”
In the past, he has gone back and forth on whether he would consider cutting benefits.
In 2020, he suggested that he would “at some point” be open to cuts, then backtracked. In March, he told CNBC, “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements”; his campaign then said he had been talking about cutting “waste,” not benefits. As president, he proposed cutting the Social Security budget in part by more aggressively combating fraud.
Housing
Ms. Harris’s housing plan calls for building three million affordable housing units within four years. She proposes creating a tax incentive to build homes that are affordable to first-time buyers, expanding an incentive to build affordable rental homes, and setting up a $40 billion “innovation fund” for developers and builders who come up with viable plans to add affordable housing.
She wants to give up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance to first-time home buyers, and she has endorsed a bill called the Stop Predatory Investing Act that would create tax penalties for investors who buy large numbers of rental units.
The Republican Party platform, which Mr. Trump and his campaign led the drafting of, calls for opening “limited portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction” and reducing inflation in order to lower mortgage rates. (The president has no direct control over interest rates.)
It also calls for “tax incentives and support for first-time buyers” and for cutting “unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs.” Mr. Trump’s campaign did not provide details on what these incentives would involve or what regulations he would cut.
In his first term, his budget requests urged Congress to reduce funding for federal housing programs, including eliminating the National Housing Trust Fund and the HOME Investment Partnerships program, which provide money to build, repair and operate housing for low-income Americans. Congress did not agree.
Mr. Trump has blamed immigrants for a lack of affordable housing, an assessment economists reject. He wants to make undocumented immigrants ineligible for mortgages.
Education
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris wants to increase funding for public schools, through measures including programs focused on low-income students. She supports the Biden administration’s student-loan forgiveness efforts and opposes laws that restrict what schools can teach about race, gender and American history.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump wants to abolish the Department of Education, give parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools or home-school them, and restrict what schools can teach about race, gender and American history. He opposes student-debt forgiveness and affirmative action.
K-12 Education Funding
Ms. Harris supports the Department of Education and has denounced Mr. Trump’s calls to abolish it. She wants to increase funding for public schools, as the Biden administration has done through, among other things, an expansion of Title I funding for low-income students.
She has not spoken recently about “school choice” programs, which would provide federal funding for parents to send their children to private schools or home-school them, and which Mr. Trump supports. But the Democratic Party platform opposes them: It rejects policies, including vouchers for private schooling, “that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education.”
During her 2019 presidential campaign, Ms. Harris supported universal prekindergarten — as the Democratic platform still does — and proposed more than $300 billion in federal funding to increase teachers’ salaries by an average of $13,500. Her campaign did not confirm whether she still supported the salary proposal.
Mr. Trump wants to eliminate the Department of Education, a proposal he also made during his 2016 campaign. In office, he sought repeatedly to cut the department’s budget, but Congress never obliged.
“We’re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,” he said in a campaign video last year. “We’re going to close it up. All those buildings all over the place, and you have people that in many cases hate our children. We’re going to send it all back to the states.”
He says he would spend “less than half” what the federal government currently does on education. “We’ll have one person plus a secretary,” he said in October. “And all the person has to do is: Are you teaching English? Are you teaching arithmetic? What are you doing, reading, writing and arithmetic, and are you not teaching woke.”
He wants to provide federal funding for parents to send their children to private schools or home-school them — a proposal that is known by supporters as school choice, and that Mr. Trump calls the “civil rights issue of our time.”
He signed an executive order in 2020 that let states use anti-poverty funding for school vouchers during the pandemic, and last year he said he wanted to replicate Iowa’s program to give every student public funds for private-school tuition. As president, he signed legislation letting families use up to $10,000 a year in tax-exempt money from “529” college savings accounts for private-school tuition starting in elementary school, and he now wants to allow that money to be used for home-schooling expenses as well.
He has vowed to withhold funding from schools that require vaccinations or that he deems to have promoted “transgender ideology” or “critical race theory,” a reference to discussions of how racism affects American society. (His campaign has said the vaccination statement applies only to Covid vaccines, but Mr. Trump doesn’t specify that.) He also says he would offer “massive funding preferences and favorable treatment” for states and school districts that eliminate tenure, reduce the number of administrators and let parents elect principals.
Curriculums
Ms. Harris opposes laws restricting what schools can teach students about race, gender and American history, and curriculums that she has said present a sanitized version of history.
“They want to replace history with lies,” she said in a speech last year condemning new curriculum standards in Florida that suggested some enslaved people had benefited from slavery. “These extremist so-called leaders should model what we know to be the correct and right approach if we really are invested in the well-being of our children. Instead, they dare to push propaganda to our children.”
She has also condemned restrictions on what books students can read in classes or libraries — “we see extremists who pass book bans, book bans in this year of our Lord 2024,” she said in February — and laws like one in Florida that prevent teachers from discussing gender identity and sexual orientation.
Mr. Trump has called for restricting what schools can teach students about race, gender and American history, and for requiring “patriotic” curriculums.
He wants to ban “radical gender ideology” and “critical race theory,” terms Republicans use to refer to acceptance of transgender people and to discussions of the effects of racism on American society. He has suggested he would enforce these restrictions by withholding funding to schools that disobeyed, but he has not explained how he would reconcile that with his pledge to delegate education funding and decisions to states, and his campaign did not answer that question.
In a campaign video last year, he called for “bringing back prayer to our schools” and teaching students “to love their country, not to hate their country,” even as he has said he wants teachers who “understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children.” He said he would create a “credentialing body” to certify teachers who “embrace patriotic values” and “support our way of life.”
He also wants to make it easier to fire teachers. “If we have pink-haired communists teaching our kids, we have a major problem,” he said last year.
College Funding and Debt
Ms. Harris has endorsed the Biden administration’s student-loan forgiveness and repayment assistance programs and said she would continue them. Courts have blocked three such programs — the Supreme Court struck down a $400 billion plan last year, and judges halted others in July and October — but the administration has used existing mechanisms to forgive about $175 billion in student debt.
She has also praised the funding increases President Biden has signed for historically Black colleges and universities, and a $900 increase in the maximum amount of Pell Grants for college students from low-income families. She has not confirmed whether she supports the additional $750 increase that Mr. Biden sought for Pell Grants in his most recent budget request.
During her 2019 presidential campaign, she proposed a debt forgiveness program for “Pell Grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities”; her campaign did not say whether she still supported that. Earlier, when she was the attorney general of California, she successfully sued a for-profit chain of colleges for false and predatory advertising, and as vice president, she supported debt cancellation for its students.
As a senator, she also supported making two-year community colleges free for everyone, and making public four-year colleges free for families earning less than $125,000 a year. Her campaign did not confirm her current position.
She supports the Biden administration’s apprenticeship policies, and her campaign says she would “do even more to scale up programs that create good career pathways for non-college graduates,” but it has not provided details on what that would involve. Mr. Biden directed more than $240 million in new funding to a federal apprenticeship program, while eliminating a Trump-era program that had let companies and industry groups develop apprenticeships. He said that program duplicated the existing one while offering fewer protections for workers.
Mr. Trump said last year that he would tax private universities’ endowments and use the money to fund a free online university that would “gather an entire universe of the highest quality educational content,” offer “study groups, mentors, industry partnerships and the latest breakthrough in computing” and ultimately grant bachelor’s degrees.
He did not provide details on how this would work, such as whether it would involve professors or just video and text lessons. His campaign also did not answer that question.
He opposes student-loan forgiveness, calling it unfair to people who paid off their debt. His administration weakened a measure, the “borrower defense” rule, that discharges federal student loans if their college is found to have deceived them or engaged in illegal activity, and he vetoed a bipartisan resolution seeking to reverse those changes. It also denied about 99 percent of applications under a debt forgiveness program for public servants.
The Republican Party platform, which Mr. Trump personally directed, calls for a focus on alternatives to traditional college degrees. He has called for increasing access to internships and career counseling, and his administration created a program for companies and industry groups to develop apprenticeships.
Affirmative Action
Ms. Harris has denounced the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling rejecting affirmative action.
“It is well established that all students benefit when classrooms and campuses reflect the incredible diversity of our nation,” she said in a statement at the time. “Colleges and universities provide opportunities for students to interact with Americans from all walks of life and learn from one another. By making our schools less diverse, this ruling will harm the educational experience for all students.”
The Justice and Education Departments under Mr. Biden said that, as they interpreted the ruling, universities could still prioritize nonwhite students for “outreach and recruitment” as long as everyone had “the same opportunity to apply and compete for admission.” Ms. Harris’s campaign did not confirm whether she agreed with that interpretation.
Mr. Trump says he would direct the Justice Department to pursue civil rights claims against any school or university “that engages in unlawful racial discrimination,” a reference to affirmative action, which the Supreme Court rejected last year.
He appointed three of the six justices who made that decision, and he praised it when it came down. His administration also pushed against affirmative action before the ruling: In 2018, the Education and Justice Departments rescinded Obama-era guidelines that had encouraged colleges to take race into account in admissions in order to make their campuses more diverse.
The Supreme Court excluded military academies from its ruling, meaning affirmative action programs are still legal there. But Mr. Trump has expressed broad opposition to the programs, and his administration would have the ability to choose not to defend them in court, though his campaign did not confirm whether it would.
Foreign Policy
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris supports an active global role for the United States, including in NATO and other military alliances, and wants to continue to send military aid to Ukraine. She has not given many details on her policies toward China but has said she wants to protect the United States against China’s economic practices without cutting ties entirely.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump has criticized alliances like NATO and suggested that he would encourage Russia to invade a member country if he didn’t think the country was paying enough for its defense. He has indicated that he is reluctant to send further military aid to Ukraine and has said he wants to “eliminate” the United States’ economic dependence on China.
Alliances
Ms. Harris supports an active global role for the United States, including a commitment to international alliances.
“Our leadership keeps our homeland safe, supports American jobs, secures supply chains and opens new markets for American goods,” she told world leaders at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying she saw U.S. engagement as a strategic good for Americans, not as an act of “charity” toward other countries.
She added that she rejected calls “to isolate ourselves from the world, to flout common understandings among nations, to embrace dictators and adopt their repressive tactics, and abandon commitments to our allies in favor of unilateral action.”
She has spoken positively about the recent expansion of NATO to include Finland and Sweden. Her campaign did not respond to a question about whether she would support admitting Ukraine to the alliance after the war there ends. When she was asked about it in a “60 Minutes” interview in October, she said it was an issue “that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point.”
Mr. Trump often criticizes NATO and, as president, suggested withdrawing from it, describing it as a drain on American resources. He has not ruled out withdrawing from NATO in a second term, and his campaign did not confirm whether he would.
He could also weaken the alliance without leaving it. In a video on his campaign website, he calls for “fundamentally re-evaluating” the alliance’s “purpose” and “mission.” Asked what that meant, his campaign did not give a direct answer but pointed to a speech in August in which he said he would “insist” that NATO members spend 3 percent of their gross domestic product on their militaries instead of a current nonbinding target of 2 percent.
In February, he said he might even encourage President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to invade a NATO country if he thought it wasn’t paying enough. (Some countries have not met the NATO goal for spending on their militaries, but they do not owe money to the alliance.) He said that a European leader had once asked, “If we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?” and that he had responded: “No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.”
He has also suggested stepping back from other alliances. He disparaged a mutual defense treaty between the United States and Japan and wrote on social media this year, “We should never give money anymore without the hope of a payback, or without ‘strings’ attached.”
Ukraine
Ms. Harris supports continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine, arguing that conceding Ukrainian territory to Russia would destabilize the region and encourage President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to invade other countries, such as Poland.
“It is in the strategic interest of the United States to continue our support,” she said at a security conference in Germany this year. President Biden has overseen more than $100 billion in military and economic aid to Ukraine. Ms. Harris’s campaign did not say how the amount of aid she supported would compare.
At the presidential debate in September, Ms. Harris said, “I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up.” She argued that the implications of the war were broad, saying it was essential for the United States to defend “one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
She said later that month that calls for Ukraine to give up territory or to agree not to join military alliances were proposals not for peace but “for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.”
She has emphasized, including in the debate and at the Democratic National Convention, that she met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine a few days before Russia invaded in 2022 to share U.S. intelligence about the impending invasion, and that she helped mobilize a coalition of countries to support Ukraine.
Mr. Trump insists he could end the war in Ukraine before his inauguration, saying he would talk to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and get them to agree to a deal.
He has refused to describe the deal he envisions — “I don’t want to tell you,” he said in September — but it would almost certainly involve Ukraine giving up territory to Russia, which Mr. Zelensky has made clear he does not intend to do.
Russia started the war by invading Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has framed it as a dispute between two good-faith parties that want a “fair deal,” saying, “I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop.” In the debate in September, he declined to say he wanted a Ukrainian victory, suggesting that a speedy end to the war was more important than who won.
“It’s in the U.S.’s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done,” he said.
Mr. Trump, who was impeached in 2019 for withholding U.S. aid to pressure Mr. Zelensky to help him politically, suggested to Fox News last year that he could have prevented the war by pre-emptively persuading Ukraine to cede land. “At worst, I could’ve made a deal to take over something,” he said. “There are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly.”
He has not given definitive answers when asked whether he would sign additional military aid to Ukraine if Congress approved it. However, he has questioned the need for further aid, suggested that it should be structured as a loan and criticized the amount already given.
“This fight is far more important for Europe than it is for the U.S.,” he said last year, adding: “Start by telling Europe that they must pay at least equal to what the U.S. is paying to help Ukraine. They must also pay us, retroactively, the difference.”
China
Ms. Harris’s campaign website says she would “make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century.” But she has not provided many concrete policy details.
She has said she would prioritize the continued distribution of funding from legislation that President Biden has signed — including the Inflation Reduction Act, a bipartisan infrastructure deal and the CHIPS and Science Act — that could increase domestic manufacturing of goods that the United States now relies on China for. Her campaign has also indicated, without specifics, that she is open to some tariffs, though not the across-the-board ones Mr. Trump has called for.
In contrast to Mr. Trump, she has not called for a full decoupling of the American and Chinese economies. “It’s not about pulling out, but it is about ensuring that we are protecting American interests, and that we are a leader in terms of the rules of the road, as opposed to following others’ rules,” she told CBS News last year, adding: “There’s tension when you are in a competition of any sort, but that does not mean that we are seeking conflict.”
She has defended legislation that Mr. Biden signed in April, which says that TikTok’s Chinese owner must sell it or the app will be banned in the United States. She has said that the administration does not want a ban, only a change in ownership.
In 2022, she condemned China’s incursions into the South China Sea and said she and Mr. Biden would “support Taiwan’s self-defense” and “deepen our unofficial ties.” But she has not confirmed whether she supports military aid to Taiwan, nor whether she would defend Taiwan militarily if China attacked it.
In 2019, she called for federal funding for “law enforcement efforts to cut off the supply of fentanyl from China”; her campaign did not say whether she still supports that, or what specifically it would involve if so. She also emphasized the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. As a senator, she cosponsored (and Mr. Trump signed) the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which authorized sanctions, and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which required annual assessments of the U.S.-Hong Kong trade relationship.
Mr. Trump has vowed to take an even harder line on China than he did in his first term, when he imposed tariffs on Chinese products, leading to an escalating trade war whose costs were mostly borne by Americans. (Mr. Biden has largely continued the tariffs.) He is calling for tariffs of 60 percent or more on Chinese products and 100 percent or more on cars made by Chinese companies in Mexico.
He has also said he would “phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods,” restrict American companies’ ability to invest in China and revoke China’s “most favored nation” trade status, greatly reducing economic cooperation. He claims his plan would “eliminate U.S. dependence on China,” a monumentally difficult goal.
He has changed some of his positions, most prominently on banning TikTok out of security concerns about its Chinese parent company. He opposed a bill that Mr. Biden signed in April to ban the app in the United States unless its owner sells it, though in 2020, Mr. Trump tried to ban it himself through a pair of executive actions that a court partly blocked.
He has not said whether he would take military action if China invaded Taiwan, and his campaign did not respond when asked if he would consider it in that situation or any other.
When asked a similar question on Fox News in January, he did not give a straight answer, instead criticizing Taiwan for taking “all of our chip business,” a reference to semiconductors. Speaking to Bloomberg Businessweek in June, he repeated that and suggested that Taiwan should pay the United States to defend it.
As president, he took an inconsistent approach to China’s incursions in the South China Sea. In 2017, his administration limited Navy patrols in disputed waters. But in 2020, he imposed penalties on 24 companies for helping the Chinese government build artificial islands in those waters.
He has repeatedly praised President Xi Jinping. “Central casting, brilliant guy,” he said last year. “You know, when I say he’s brilliant, everyone says, ‘Oh, well, that’s terrible, you call him’ — well, he runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. Smart, brilliant, everything perfect.”
Iran
Ms. Harris said in July that she was committed to supporting Israel against Iran and Iran-backed militia groups like Hezbollah.
During her Senate campaign in 2016, she said she backed the Iran nuclear deal reached by former President Barack Obama and foreign leaders, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. She called it “the best available option for blocking Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability and to avoid potentially disastrous military conflict in the Middle East.”
Mr. Trump ended the Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama and foreign leaders, under which Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. His administration tightened sanctions and assassinated an Iranian commander, and Iran abandoned the restrictions on its nuclear program.
He said in September that he was open to talks on a different agreement, but gave no details.
After Iran launched a retaliatory strike on Israel in April, he told Time magazine that he would support Israel in the event of Iranian attacks.
In September, he said that if he were president and Iran threatened an American political candidate — as it recently threatened him, according to a briefing he received — he would tell Iran’s leaders, “If you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens.”
Afghanistan
Ms. Harris has defended Mr. Biden’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021 — which resulted in the Taliban almost immediately retaking the country from the Afghan government that the United States had supported — and said she was the last person in the room when he made it.
“Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,” she said at the presidential debate in September. “As a result, America’s taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world.”
Mr. Trump negotiated directly with the Taliban to try to reach a peace agreement in Afghanistan. Those talks, which did not include the American-backed government in Afghanistan, led to a deal in 2020 in which the U.S. agreed to withdraw its troops in exchange for conditions including the Taliban cutting ties with terrorist groups like Al Qaeda.
It was that deal that created the timetable that culminated with Mr. Biden’s withdrawal of troops in 2021. Mr. Trump has argued, without providing details, that he would have carried out the withdrawal in a more orderly fashion.
Health Care
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris wants to make permanent the Biden administration’s expanded subsidies for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, broaden direct negotiations between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, and provide Medicare coverage for long-term at-home care.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump, who tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then took a series of steps that weakened it, has said that he still wants to replace the A.C.A. but that he does not have a plan for how to do so. He closed a federal pandemic preparedness office and defied scientific guidance in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Health Coverage
Ms. Harris has called for “expanding and strengthening” the Affordable Care Act and also supports its current provisions, including protections for coverage of pre-existing medical conditions.
She wants to make permanent the larger subsidies that President Biden signed to help Americans buy insurance in A.C.A. marketplaces, which helped increase A.C.A. enrollment to record levels and lower the uninsured rate to 7.7 percent in 2023 from 9.7 percent in 2020. Under current law, those subsidies are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. Her campaign did not give other examples of how she would aim to expand the A.C.A.
In October, she called for Medicare coverage for long-term at-home care. Her plan would cover the cost of services like home health aides for the first time, allowing more seniors and other people with disabilities to stay in their homes rather than nursing facilities.
She has also promoted the Biden administration’s incentives for states to offer Medicaid coverage for 12 months after childbirth, instead of the minimum requirement of two months, to reduce maternal mortality rates. Only three states offered that when or shortly after Mr. Biden took office in 2021, but now almost all do.
And she supports a Biden administration rule requiring insurers to assess their provider networks, out-of-network reimbursement rates and other processes to determine whether they provide equivalent access to mental health care and other health care, and to make changes if not.
When Ms. Harris first ran for president in 2019, she supported a “Medicare for all” system that would have extended government health coverage to all Americans, while allowing private insurers to offer plans within the Medicare system under strict standards. She no longer supports Medicare for all, though she still voices the principle that health care should be “a right, not a privilege.”
Mr. Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and when that failed in Congress, he urged courts to strike down the law. (The Supreme Court declined.) As recently as last November, he said Republicans should “never give up” on repealing the A.C.A.
He tried to distance himself from that in April, saying he was “not running to terminate” the A.C.A. But in the presidential debate in September, he called it “lousy health care” and said he wanted to replace it, while acknowledging that he had no plan for how to do so. “I have concepts of a plan,” he said, adding: “I would only change it if we come up with something better and less expensive. And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.”
His campaign has provided no information since then and did not answer specific questions — including whether Mr. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, was correct in suggesting that the former president would let insurers put young, healthy people in separate “risk pools” from older and sicker people, a pre-A.C.A. practice that could lower premiums for healthy people but make them unaffordable for sick people.
The campaign provided only a nonspecific statement that Mr. Trump would increase “transparency” and promote “choice and competition.” It has strongly suggested that he opposes extending Biden-era subsidies for people to buy insurance through the A.C.A.
Short of repeal, Mr. Trump took steps to weaken the A.C.A. when he was president: He signed legislation eliminating the individual mandate, cut funding for promoting the law and helping people enroll, ended subsidies to insurance companies that had helped lower premiums, and allowed insurers to offer plans that did not meet the law’s original standards.
His administration also let states cap Medicaid spending — reducing benefits for people who had gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act — and sought to allow work requirements for recipients, though a court blocked that in some places.
In an executive order in 2019, he directed the secretary of health and human services to find ways to give Medicare beneficiaries “more diverse and affordable” choices, including by promoting private Medicare Advantage plans, and to loosen regulations and reassess reimbursement rates.
The number of uninsured Americans under 65 increased in three of the four years of Mr. Trump’s presidency, after having declined every year since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010.
Medical Costs
Ms. Harris supports direct negotiations between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies on prescription drug costs. Those negotiations were enabled for the first time by the Inflation Reduction Act, on which she cast the tiebreaking vote. Her economic plan says she would “allow Medicare to accelerate the speed of negotiations” to bring more drugs into that program.
She has also called for expanding two price caps for Medicare recipients — $35 a month for insulin and $2,000 a year for all out-of-pocket prescription expenses — to cover all Americans.
She supports a Biden administration rule to remove medical debt from credit reports, as well as the administration’s cancellation of about $7 billion in such debt through a 2021 pandemic relief bill. Her campaign says she wants to cancel more medical debt if she is elected.
Mr. Trump pledged in 2023 to reissue an executive order seeking to require pharmaceutical companies to offer Medicare the lowest prices they offer other developed countries. But he recently abandoned that proposal and deleted a video describing it from his website. His campaign told the health news website Stat in October, “There is no push to renew the most favored nations drug pricing policy.”
He first issued that order in September 2020, as negotiations with drug companies collapsed over his administration’s insistence that the companies — which had been poised to commit $150 billion to lowering consumer costs — pay for $100 gift cards for seniors before the election that year.
While he endorsed letting Medicare directly negotiate prices in 2016, he backed off that policy once he was in office.
His administration approved a plan to let states import some prescription drugs from Canada, where they are often cheaper. He also signed a ban on most surprise medical bills and established a program under which some, but not all, Medicare plans offered insulin for $35 a month.
Public Health
Ms. Harris has made government interventions to reduce maternal mortality a significant focus. Among other steps, she has promoted incentives from the Biden administration to expand postpartum coverage through Medicaid, as well as funding to train health care providers to avoid implicit biases that result in higher mortality rates for Black women.
In 2022 and again this July, she was the public face of the introduction of the Biden administration’s maternal health policies, which included setting federal health and safety standards for hospital obstetrics services and creating a mental health hotline for mothers.
She and Mr. Biden vowed to control the Covid-19 pandemic more effectively than Mr. Trump did. But the virus killed more Americans in 2021 than in 2020, a result of factors including more transmissible variants, fewer precautions among the public and the reluctance of a substantial minority of Americans to accept vaccines.
Initially, the administration mandated that people wear masks on public transportation; oversaw a vaccine rollout, including through FEMA sites, that got more than two-thirds of Americans vaccinated; and established “test to treat” sites where people could receive a Covid test and an antiviral prescription at the same time. It also expanded a Trump-era program that measures levels of the coronavirus and other pathogens in sewage, and created a White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy.
Over time, the administration loosened mitigation policies, in some cases by court order and in other cases by choice.
Mr. Biden’s proposed budget for 2025 includes billions of dollars in new funding to prepare for and respond to pandemics, and to promote vaccinations among adults. Ms. Harris’s campaign did not confirm whether her budget requests in those categories would be the same.
Mr. Trump closed a pandemic preparedness office that President Barack Obama had created and said in April that he “probably would” close a similar office created by Mr. Biden, calling it a waste of resources when, in his view, the country could mobilize when a pandemic hit.
He responded haphazardly to the Covid-19 pandemic, delegating most mitigation efforts to state officials, downplaying the virus, disregarding scientists’ advice and promoting unproven and dangerous supposed treatments. The United States had a higher excess mortality rate in 2020 than almost any developed country, and a similar pattern continued under Mr. Biden.
The Trump administration was responsible for Operation Warp Speed, a federal effort that enabled the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines that have saved millions of lives. But while Mr. Trump initially encouraged people to get vaccinated, he backed off as much of his base refused. That partisan opposition to vaccines has contributed to higher death rates in red states than in blue ones.
Mr. Trump now says he would withhold funding from schools that require vaccines. His campaign has said he means only Covid vaccines, though he does not specify that in his calls for the policy, which he usually phrases as, “I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.” Every state requires schoolchildren to be vaccinated against illnesses like measles and polio, and Mr. Trump has long promoted the debunked claim that childhood vaccines cause autism.
His campaign said he would create a commission “of independent minds who are not bought and paid for by Big Pharma” to investigate increases in chronic illness.
His administration rolled back environmental regulations intended to reduce air and water pollution, and rejected a proposal to ban a pesticide linked to developmental disabilities.
In 2018, he signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which provided funding for state and tribal committees to collect and analyze data about deaths related to pregnancy.
Addiction and Opioids
Ms. Harris supports increasing federal funding to states for addiction treatment programs, as the Biden administration has done.
She has also endorsed the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to make naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, available over the counter; new federal rules allowing methadone and buprenorphine, two common treatments for opioid use disorder, to be prescribed by telemedicine; and the removal of a restriction on which medical providers could prescribe buprenorphine.
Overdose deaths have begun to decline over the past two years after a long period of increases, but they still take the lives of tens of thousands of people annually.
Ms. Harris says she would push Congress to pass a bipartisan border-security bill that Mr. Trump torpedoed this year, which — in addition to cracking down on illegal border crossings — would provide more funding for technology to detect and intercept illicit drugs. She also said in September that she would “double” the Justice Department’s resources for fighting transnational drug cartels that bring fentanyl into the United States.
Mr. Trump designated opioid addiction as a public health emergency in 2017.
Among other actions, he enacted a “safer prescribing plan” with a goal of reducing opioid prescriptions by one-third and signed increases in funding for research on pain management and addiction. He also signed a bill in 2018 that expanded Medicare and Medicaid coverage for addiction treatment, directed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to work to increase medical provider capacity for such treatment, and took a number of other steps to improve access to addiction care for rural Americans, minors and pregnant women.
Drug overdose deaths, which had been rising for years, declined slightly in 2018 but increased again in 2019 and 2020.
This year, Mr. Trump has approached opioid addiction and overdoses almost exclusively through the lens of border security, arguing for closing the southern border to stop the flow of fentanyl as well as people. (Most fentanyl is smuggled through legal ports of entry.)
He has suggested using military force against Mexican drug cartels, even if the Mexican government did not consent to operations on its soil. He has also called for the death penalty for drug dealers and suggested that their due process should be limited, praising China’s “quick” trials to sentence people to death for drug crimes.
His campaign did not say whether he planned to further increase access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone or to addiction treatments.
Immigration
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris denounced many of the Trump administration’s immigration policies but has endorsed President Biden’s decisions to restore some of them, such as restrictions on asylum seekers, as illegal border crossings have reached record levels. She has tried to address root causes of migration by securing private funding for development projects in Latin America.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump enacted sweeping anti-immigration policies when he was president, including separating migrant children from their parents. If elected again, he wants to round up millions of undocumented immigrants and detain them in camps before deporting them en masse.
Illegal Immigration
Ms. Harris has taken a relatively tough stance on immigration recently, emphasizing her support for a bipartisan proposal that would have hired thousands of new border security agents and asylum officers and closed the border if crossings reached an average of more than 5,000 migrants a day over a week.
The deal died in Congress after Mr. Trump came out against it, but Ms. Harris has pledged to work to get it passed if elected president. She has also indicated that she would maintain a policy that Mr. Biden enacted this year through executive action, barring asylum applications from most people who cross the border illegally.
She approached the issue differently during her first presidential campaign in 2019, when she argued that it should not be a crime to enter the United States without authorization and called for re-examining the role of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. (Decriminalizing border crossings was a popular position among candidates in the Democratic presidential primary that year.) Her tone changed after she became vice president, and this August, she told CNN: “We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequence.”
She supports DACA, the Obama-era program formally called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals under which people brought to the United States illegally as children are protected from being deported. Because judges have ruled against the program, including one ruling last year, Ms. Harris urged Congress in June to pass legislation that would permanently protect DACA beneficiaries, commonly known as Dreamers.
In 2019, she called for using executive action to extend DACA-like protections to other groups as well, including undocumented immigrants whose children are citizens or legal permanent residents. Her campaign did not say whether she still supported that.
One of her mandates as vice president has been to address the root causes of migration from Latin America, such as poverty and violence. She has mainly sought to do this through a program called the Partnership for Central America, which has secured more than $5 billion in pledges from private companies to support Central American communities.
The program has focused on El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Border encounters with migrants from those countries have fallen sharply, though migration from other countries soared over much of the same period.
If re-elected, Mr. Trump is planning a deportation operation that he has called the largest in American history.
He plans to round up undocumented immigrants and detain them in camps while they await deportation, rely on a form of expulsion that doesn’t involve due process hearings, and deputize local police officers and National Guard troops from Republican-led states to carry out immigration raids. During a rally in September, he said that expelling some migrants would be “a bloody story.”
He says he would use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport people without due process. That law, which allows summary detention or deportation of people from countries that are at war with the United States or that have engaged in “predatory incursions,” was last invoked to put Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II.
He suggested in September that he would start by targeting specific cities whose migrant populations his campaign has demonized, including Springfield, Ohio — where most migrants are in the country legally — and Aurora, Colo.
Altogether, Mr. Trump said to Time magazine in April that he would aim to deport as many as 15 million to 20 million people — numbers that are equivalent to the population of New York State at the high end.
In the same interview, he said he might deploy the military against migrants both along the border and in nonborder states, claiming that a law that forbids the use of the military for domestic law enforcement would not apply because people who are in the U.S. illegally “aren’t civilians.” In October, he said he would hire 10,000 new border agents, increasing the force by more than 50 percent.
He also wants to revoke birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants, which overwhelming legal consensus holds to be guaranteed under the 14th Amendment.
All of this would be an escalation from his first term, during which he separated thousands of migrant children from their parents and held them in crowded, unsanitary facilities. During a CNN event last year, he did not rule out reinstating family separation.
Mr. Trump diverted money from the military budget to build a border wall without congressional approval. While a wall was his signature promise in 2016, his administration built fewer than 500 miles of barriers along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border during his first term.
He has repeatedly dehumanized migrants, including saying on multiple occasions that they are “poisoning the blood” of the country and calling some of them “animals” and “not people, in my opinion.”
Asylum
Ms. Harris has endorsed an executive order that Mr. Biden issued in June, closing the border to asylum seekers when the seven-day average for illegal entries hits 2,500 a day. The most restrictive border policy enacted by any modern Democratic president, it is similar to a 2018 Trump policy that was blocked by a federal judge, and it faces a similar legal challenge.
She also wants to revive a bipartisan border-security deal from earlier this year that would have made it harder to claim asylum while also including a right to counsel for certain applicants, including unaccompanied children 13 and under.
The Trump administration forced asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting hearings, leading to the development of squalid refugee camps along the border. He has said he wants to reinstate that policy if elected again.
In 2018, he suspended asylum rights for people who entered the country illegally, a policy that was blocked by a federal judge.
His administration used the coronavirus pandemic to lay the legal groundwork for denying asylum seekers entry into the United States, something he had expressed interest in but had been unable to do beforehand. The emergency public health measure he invoked, Title 42, allowed the government to quickly expel migrants who crossed the border.
He wants to reinstate Title 42 if elected again, this time based on claims that migrants carry diseases like tuberculosis rather than the coronavirus.
Legal Immigration
Ms. Harris has said in various forums that she supports “an earned pathway to citizenship” for undocumented immigrants. Her campaign did not respond to a request for details on the criteria she envisioned.
The bipartisan border-security deal from earlier this year that she has endorsed would have added 250,000 family- and employment-based visas over five years and ensured green-card eligibility for the children of immigrants who are in the country on H-1B visas for highly skilled workers. It also would have enacted measures to reduce illegal border crossings.
Mr. Trump tried, but Congress did not agree, to greatly reduce legal immigration by limiting U.S. citizens’ ability to bring in relatives and by increasing education and skill requirements.
In 2019, he began denying permanent residency to immigrants deemed likely to require public assistance, a rule that disproportionately affected people from Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. He also significantly limited H-1B visas for skilled workers, but while privately courting business leaders in June, he talked up the importance of high-skilled immigration.
If elected again, he has called for revoking the legal status of people — including Afghan refugees — who have been allowed into the country for humanitarian reasons, as well as revoking the student visas of people whom he called “radical anti-American and antisemitic foreigners.”
In June, he called for automatically giving green cards to foreign students who graduated from a U.S. college. But his campaign quickly walked that back, saying that only the “most skilled graduates” would be included and that their political ideologies would be vetted.
He said at rallies in October that he would put in place “strong ideological screening” for visa applicants, barring anyone who was “communist, Marxist or fascist,” who sympathized with “radical Islamic terrorists and extremists,” who wanted “to abolish the state of Israel” or who did not “like our religion.” (The U.S. has no state religion, and the First Amendment doesn’t allow one.)
His campaign also said he would expand a program from his first term to strip citizenship from naturalized immigrants whom he determined to be “criminals, terrorists and immigration cheats.”
Travel Bans
Ms. Harris opposed Mr. Trump’s travel bans, which barred travelers from several majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States and which Mr. Biden revoked on his first day in office. In 2020, she called an expansion of the initial ban “un-American” and “clearly driven by hate, not security.”
One of Mr. Trump’s first actions upon taking office was to ban travelers from several majority-Muslim countries. He has said he would reinstate and expand that ban if elected again.
Israel and Gaza
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris has said that Israel has a right to defend itself against Hamas and that the United States should continue to send it weapons, while calling for a cease-fire and putting somewhat greater emphasis than President Biden has on the humanitarian crisis that Israel’s bombardment and invasion have caused in Gaza. She supports a two-state solution.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump has sought to position himself as a champion of Israel, and as president, he took actions that favored the country. He supports Israel in its war in Gaza and has condemned pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the United States, but he has also urged Israel to “finish up” the war because it is losing support. He said recently that he doubted a two-state solution was possible.
War in Gaza
Ms. Harris supports a cease-fire in which Hamas would release all hostages who were seized in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza. She first called for a cease-fire in early March, describing the situation in Gaza as a “humanitarian catastrophe.”
However, her national security adviser said in August that she would not support an arms embargo to end the American weapons shipments on which Israel has relied. In an interview with CNN later that month, she did not endorse any changes to Mr. Biden’s policy on providing weapons, and her campaign did not respond when asked whether she would support any restrictions short of a full embargo.
Compared with Mr. Biden, she has centered Palestinians more in her public comments and taken a sharper tone in criticizing Israel, emphasizing the toll of Israel’s bombardment and invasion of Gaza. While not publicly diverging on policy, she has privately pushed Mr. Biden to weigh the plight of Palestinian civilians more heavily in his decisions and statements.
“Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” she said in July after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. She added: “The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time — we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.”
In an interview in March, she urged Israel not to invade Rafah, the city in southern Gaza to which more than a million people had fled. “I have studied the maps,” she said. “There’s nowhere for those folks to go, and we’re looking at about 1.5 million people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there, most of them.”
After Hamas’s attack, Mr. Trump vowed to “fully support” Israel. He was also initially critical of Mr. Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence, calling them unprepared — though he quickly backtracked from those remarks and said he stood with Mr. Netanyahu, with whom he was closely allied as president.
In March, he urged Israel to “finish up” the war quickly because it was losing support — a message he repeated in July, saying Israel was “getting decimated with this publicity.” But he also expressed his continued support of the country’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza. In an interview with a conservative Israeli news outlet, he said that he “would act very much the same way” and that “you would have to be crazy not to.”
He suggested that Israel had hurt its cause, in terms of international public opinion, by releasing images of the damage in Gaza. “I think that Israel has done one thing very badly: public relations,” he told Time magazine in April.
He said in July that a speech in which Ms. Harris condemned civilian casualties in Gaza had been “disrespectful to Israel.”
Refugees
Ms. Harris’s campaign did not respond to questions about whether she would maintain Mr. Biden’s deferral of deportations for Palestinians who are in the United States illegally, or whether she would allow more Gazan refugees to come.
Mr. Trump said last year that the United States should bar Gazan refugees from entering the country.
Two-State Solution
Ms. Harris has endorsed a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians would live side-by-side in their own sovereign countries.
“I know right now it is hard to conceive of that prospect,” she said in July. “But a two-state solution is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure, Jewish and democratic state and one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security and prosperity that they rightly deserve.”
When she met with Mr. Netanyahu that month, she expressed “concern about actions that undermine stability and security in the West Bank, such as extremist settler violence and settlement expansion,” according to a White House summary. Her office also said in December that “under no circumstances” would the United States accept “the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank.”
In the past, she has been more reluctant to describe Israel’s actions as barriers to a two-state solution. In 2016, she declined to endorse hypothetical legislation that would deem Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal, saying, “The terms of any agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians cannot be imposed by others.” In 2017, she was a sponsor of a Senate resolution that condemned the United Nations Security Council for deeming the settlements illegal and accused the United Nations of “a longstanding biased approach” to Israel.
Her campaign did not respond to a question about her current views on the legality of Israeli settlements.
As president, Mr. Trump proposed a peace plan that he called a blueprint for a two-state solution, but Palestinians did not see it that way.
The plan, which was never adopted, strongly favored Israeli priorities. It was developed without substantive Palestinian input and, while it would have given the Palestinians a limited degree of sovereignty and a pathway to possibly more, it would not have created a fully autonomous Palestinian state. It called for making Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel, relegating the Palestinian capital to the outskirts of the city and letting Israel keep its West Bank settlements and control of the Jordan Valley.
More recently, Mr. Trump told Time magazine: “There was a time when I thought two-state could work. Now I think two-state is going to be very, very tough.”
Mr. Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a decision that threw a wrench into the possibility of peace talks and caused some Palestinian leaders to describe a two-state solution as dead.
He also ended decades of U.S. opposition to Israeli settlements, which significantly expanded during his administration, and he cut aid for Palestinians.
Israel and Other Countries
Ms. Harris said in July that she was committed to supporting Israel against Iran and Iran-backed militia groups like Hezbollah. She also defended an Israeli attack in Lebanon in September that killed Hezbollah’s leader, while saying, “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.”
During her Senate campaign in 2016, she said she backed the Iran nuclear deal reached by former President Barack Obama and foreign leaders, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The Israeli government opposed the deal, but Ms. Harris said that, “with a deep commitment to the safety of Israel,” she believed it was “the best available option for blocking Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability and to avoid potentially disastrous military conflict in the Middle East.”
When he was president, Mr. Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries and have largely held.
Earlier in his term, he recognized Israeli authority over the Golan Heights, a disputed area between Israel and Syria. That change in longstanding U.S. policy set the country apart from Israel’s Arab neighbors and the United Nations and was seen as a political gift to Mr. Netanyahu.
He also ended the Iran nuclear deal reached by Mr. Obama and foreign leaders, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. His withdrawal and reinstatement of sanctions pleased Israel, which opposed the deal.
This April, after Iran launched a retaliatory strike on Israel, Mr. Trump told Time magazine that he would support Israel in the event of Iranian attacks. He has not commented specifically on Israel’s strikes on Lebanon, beyond claiming that none of the recent conflict in the Middle East would have happened if he had been president. But in October, he told reporters, referring to Mr. Biden’s lobbying of Mr. Netanyahu: “He’s trying to hold him back, and he probably should be doing the opposite.”
Pro-Palestinian Protests
Ms. Harris has expressed more sympathy toward pro-Palestinian demonstrators than has Mr. Biden, who argued during campus demonstrations this spring that a wide range of actions — not only vandalism and intimidation, but also nonviolent disruptions that forced “the cancellation of classes and graduations” — did not qualify as peaceful.
“They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,” Ms. Harris said in an interview with The Nation published in July. “There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don’t mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.”
She has not changed any public policy position in response to the protests, though her campaign said she would “continue to engage.” When protesters interrupted her during a rally, she said their presence was a good example of democracy but responded sharply when they continued. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that,” she said. “Otherwise, I am speaking.”
She has denounced a minority of protesters who have burned flags and defaced statues, saying, “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation.”
Mr. Trump praised police crackdowns on pro-Palestinian demonstrations, calling the protesters “raging lunatics and Hamas sympathizers” and saying it had been “a beautiful thing to watch” the police break up a student occupation of a building at Columbia University.
“To every college president, I say remove the encampments immediately,” he said in early May. “Vanquish the radicals, and take back our campuses for all of the normal students.”
He has said that the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. — where a woman was killed by a neo-Nazi and many others were injured — was “a little peanut” compared with the campus protests. And he mused about whether punishment for the Columbia protesters would be “anything comparable” to how those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were punished.
Antisemitism
Ms. Harris has praised a national strategy for combating antisemitism that the Biden administration announced last year. That strategy, the first released by the U.S. government, recommended making it easier to report hate crimes, holding anti-bias workshops geared toward workplaces and hiring, and strengthening Holocaust education.
In a statement for Holocaust Remembrance Day in May, she said she understood that, for Jewish people, the months since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack had “evoked the memories, along with fear and anguish, of the Holocaust.” She added: “We will fight antisemitism with the full force of the U.S. government, including through the first-ever national strategy to counter antisemitism. We will continue to stand with the people of Israel and its right to defend itself from those that threaten its existence.”
As a senator, she cosponsored resolutions denouncing attacks on synagogues. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish and has been a public face of the Biden administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism, a role he said in August that Ms. Harris had encouraged him to take on.
Mr. Trump has described criticism of Israel as antisemitism, and his administration took steps to designate campaigns to boycott Israel as such. He has said that if elected again, he would bar immigrants who “want to abolish the state of Israel” from entering the United States.
He issued an executive order in 2019 that effectively defined Judaism as a race or nationality, in addition to a religion, in order to apply protections under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.
But he has also made antisemitic remarks and associated with antisemites. In 2017, he said there were “fine people on both sides” of a white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va.
And he has repeatedly described Jews who voted for Democrats as “disloyal” or self-hating, language that critics say invokes an antisemitic trope about Jews having a “dual loyalty,” with a greater devotion to Israel than to their own countries.
In 2022, he lamented that “our wonderful evangelicals” appreciated his support for Israel more than American Jews did. In 2023, he shared an image saying that “liberal Jews” had “voted to destroy America & Israel.” And this September, he said that if he lost, “the Jewish people would have a lot to do” with it.
Netanyahu
Ms. Harris has expressed disagreement with Mr. Netanyahu over his conduct of the war in Gaza, but she has not endorsed actions that would concretely affect his government.
Like a number of other Democrats, she skipped Mr. Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in July, but she met with him privately while he was in Washington.
Afterward, she said that she had told Mr. Netanyahu she would “always ensure that Israel is able to defend itself,” but that she had also “expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and urged him to accept a cease-fire deal.
As president, Mr. Trump strongly supported Mr. Netanyahu’s government and gave it a number of political gifts, including support for hard-line Israeli policies that previous U.S. administrations had rejected.
But ever since Mr. Trump lost the 2020 election, he has been less friendly toward Mr. Netanyahu, seemingly for a personal reason: Mr. Netanyahu congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory. After the Hamas-led attack on Israel, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Netanyahu as having been unprepared. He quickly backtracked on those remarks.
L.G.B.T.Q. Rights
Kamala Harris Ms. Harris supports legislation to ban discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. people in education, health care, housing and other areas, and she has condemned state laws restricting gender transition care, sports participation and public bathroom use for transgender people. She has supported L.G.B.T.Q. rights for more than two decades and began officiating at same-sex weddings two decades ago.
Donald Trump Mr. Trump wants to ban gender transition care for transgender youth, investigate hospitals and drug companies that are involved in such care, bar trans girls and women from girls’ and women’s sports and cut funding from schools that he says promote “radical gender ideology.” As president, he weakened L.G.B.T.Q. anti-discrimination protections and barred transgender people from the military.
Transgender Rights
Ms. Harris has publicly supported transgender rights for two decades and wrote in a message to trans people in March: “We see you. We stand with you. We won’t stop fighting for you.” However, she has not outlined many specific policies for trans people during this campaign.
During her 2019 presidential campaign, she released an L.G.B.T.Q. rights plan that called for reversing Mr. Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military (President Biden did so early in his term); requiring police departments to track and report anti-L.G.B.T.Q. crimes as a condition of receiving federal grants; and creating a program to support trans people that would include “employment assistance, creating educational pathways and ensuring greater access to housing and health care.”
She pledged to establish a White House office focused on L.G.B.T.Q. affairs, including hate crimes against transgender people, and to appoint transgender people to judgeships and leadership roles in her administration.
She also said that she would guarantee coverage for transition care, writing, “Health insurance companies that exclude or limit coverage for health care related to gender transition are engaged in discrimination, plain and simple.” However, the mechanism she proposed for doing so was a “Medicare for all” plan that she no longer supports. Her campaign did not respond when asked whether she wanted to guarantee coverage for transition care through a different mechanism, and whether she still supported the rest of her 2019 plan.
The Biden-Harris administration has defended the availability of most transition care for minors, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, though it said in June that it opposed surgery. (Transition surgeries are very rare among minors, who usually receive the nonsurgical care that the administration supports.) The administration opposes state bans on transition care for minors, and the Justice Department is challenging Tennessee’s ban in a case now before the Supreme Court.
Ms. Harris has condemned “the onslaught of state bills targeting transgender Americans,” which includes restrictions on transition care, sports participation, bathroom use and school curriculums. Asked specifically about access to transition care in October, she told NBC: “That is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary. I’m not going to put myself in a position of a doctor.”
Her support for transgender rights dates to the mid-2000s. As district attorney of San Francisco, she spoke at a transgender march and convened law enforcement officials to strategize on how to combat the “trans panic” defense, which lawyers had used to seek lesser charges in the killing of a transgender teenager. Later, when she was attorney general of California, her office filed briefs opposing state laws that barred transgender people from using bathrooms matching their identity.
Mr. Trump has vowed to enact an array of anti-transgender policies.
Several would target gender transition care such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. He wants to ban medically endorsed transition care for minors, as many Republican-led states have done; exclude providers from Medicare and Medicaid if they offer such care to minors; forbid federal agencies to “promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age”; and order the Justice Department to investigate hospitals that provide transition surgeries and pharmaceutical companies that make hormone medications.
He has spread outlandishly false claims about transition care, including that schools are giving students sex-change operations.
He also says he would bar transgender girls and women from participating in girls’ and women’s sports, direct the Education Department to punish school officials who suggest a student “could be trapped in the wrong body,” and cut funding for schools that he claims promote “radical gender ideology.” (Conservatives have applied that term to some specific policies, such as the inclusion of gender identity in curriculums or the permitting of transgender women to use women’s facilities, but also broadly to any acknowledgment of transgender identities as valid.)
During the Republican primary season, Mr. Trump signed an advocacy group’s pledge declaring that “sex is binary” and that he would direct agencies “to uphold this fact in every policy and program,” including “shelters, prisons, housing, health care, defense, education and sports.”
As president, he barred transgender service members from the military, rescinded rules that had allowed transgender students to use bathrooms matching their identity and eliminated protections against discrimination by doctors and insurers. His administration also considered defining gender as immutably determined by genitalia at birth, which would have eliminated legal recognition of trans people, and he said last year that he wants Congress to pass a law stating that the United States recognizes only two immutable genders.
In 2016, during his first presidential campaign, he criticized a North Carolina bill that barred transgender people from using public restrooms matching their identity, and said he believed people should “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.” But he has since embraced anti-transgender policies as the Republican base has done the same, seizing on them as a wedge issue.
“I talk about transgender, everyone goes crazy,” he said last year. “Who would have thought?”
Discrimination Laws
Ms. Harris supports the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in education, health care, housing, public accommodations and other areas.
She also supports Biden administration rules to prohibit medical providers and insurers that receive federal funding from discriminating against L.G.B.T.Q. patients, and to prohibit discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. students under Title IX. (The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Title IX changes in August while lawsuits proceed.)
As the district attorney of San Francisco, Ms. Harris created a unit to investigate hate crimes against L.G.B.T.Q. people. In 2006, she organized a conference of law enforcement officials to discuss how to counter the “gay panic” and “transgender panic” defenses, in which lawyers argue that clients accused of killing or assaulting gay and trans people deserve leniency because they were frightened by the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
She supported a 2014 law that banned the “panic” defenses in California, when she was the state attorney general; helped introduce legislation that would have banned them federally as a senator in 2018; and called for a federal ban during her 2019 campaign for president. She also helped introduce the Do No Harm Act, which would block religious exceptions to anti-discrimination laws.
Her campaign did not confirm whether she still supported those two bills.
“This isn’t about bathrooms,” she wrote in 2017, when the Trump administration removed anti-discrimination protections in schools. “This is about whether or not transgender people have the right to exist in the United States.”
Mr. Trump says he would reverse the Biden administration’s Title IX rule prohibiting discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. students. That is in line with his actions in his first term, when his administration ended Obama-era anti-discrimination protections by narrowing definitions of “sex discrimination” to exclude discrimination against transgender people.
His administration issued a rule allowing discrimination against transgender people in health care, and sought to establish a definition of gender under Title IX that would have forbidden recognition of transgender students’ identities.
It also argued that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not forbid workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Supreme Court rejected that argument in 2020, holding that the law’s ban on “sex discrimination” did encompass those things. But the Justice Department under Mr. Trump issued a memo interpreting the ruling narrowly, saying that employers might be entitled to religious exemptions and that the ruling was irrelevant to discrimination outside workplaces.
Mr. Trump in 2019 opposed the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in education, health care, housing, public accommodations and other areas. Asked whether he supported it now, a spokeswoman for his campaign said, “President Trump believes all Americans, regardless of race, gender or sexuality, should be treated equally under the law,” but declined to answer the question about the Equality Act.
Gay Marriage
Ms. Harris is a longtime supporter of gay marriage rights.
As district attorney of San Francisco, she officiated same-sex marriages as early as 2004, when almost no other city or state allowed them. As attorney general of California, she refused to defend Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that banned gay marriage and was later overturned by the courts.
She supported the Respect for Marriage Act, which President Biden signed in 2022 to guarantee federal recognition of same-sex marriages and to serve as a partial bulwark against the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling. That decision, in 2015, guaranteed the right to marriage to same-sex couples. Ms. Harris wrote last year that it stood “for a simple principle: all Americans are equal, and their government should treat them that way.”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s campaign would not say whether he supported the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling or the Respect for Marriage Act.
Mr. Trump said in 2011 that he opposed gay marriage, and in 2016 he told Fox News that he disagreed with the Obergefell ruling.
“I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things,” he said. Asked if he was saying he “might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage,” he replied, “I would strongly consider that, yes.”
He changed his tune after the 2016 election, saying: “It’s irrelevant because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court.” (The court can overturn precedents, and two justices have publicly indicated that they want to revisit Obergefell.)
This year’s Republican Party platform, which Mr. Trump directed the drafting of, does not include previous platforms’ statement that marriage should be solely “between one man and one woman.” It does say, “Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage,” a phrase long used by opponents of gay marriage.

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/cookie-policy:

We use a variety of tracker methods; six of the main types are explained below. This list is intended to include all categories that we use, although the categories may vary depending on the use of our site.
We use trackers to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the services through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base so that we can improve our services and your experience.
We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through trackers with other personal information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you.
Please reference the descriptions below to learn more about the kinds of trackers we use and for what purpose.
A) Cookies
A cookie is a small string of text that a website (or online service) stores on a user’s browser. It saves data on your browser about your visit to our site or other sites. It often includes a unique identifier (e.g., cookie #123).
“First-party cookies” are cookies set by us (or on our behalf) on our site. “Third-party cookies” are cookies set by other companies whose functionality is embedded into our site (e.g., google.com).
“Session cookies” are temporary cookies stored on your device while you visit our site. They expire when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” are stored on your browser for a period of time after you leave our site. Persistent cookies expire on a set expiration date, or when they are deleted manually.
We use persistent cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit. This allows us, for example, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our services, how often you return, how your use of the services may vary over time, to target advertising, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the services and customize your online experience.
You can choose whether to accept cookies by editing your browser settings. However, if cookies are refused, your experience on our site may be worse, and some features may not work as intended.
B) Pixels
Pixels (also known as “web beacons,” “GIFs” or “bugs”) are one-pixel transparent images located on web pages or messages. They track whether you have opened these web pages or messages. Upon firing, a pixel logs a visit to the current page or message and may read or set cookies.
Pixels often rely on cookies to work, so turning off cookies can impair them. But even if you turn off cookies, pixels can still detect a web page visit.
C) Javascript
JavaScript is a programming language. It can be used to write trackers that, when embedded into a page, allow us to measure how you interact with our site and other sites.
D) Software Development Kits (or SDKs)
SDKs are pieces of code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., third-party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps to collect and analyze certain device and user data.
E) Device Identifiers
Device identifiers are user-resettable identifiers comprised of numbers and letters. They are unique to a specific device. They are stored directly on the device. They are used to recognize you and/or your devices(s) on, off and across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes.
F) ID Synching
In order to decide what type of ad might interest you, our digital and marketing vendors sometimes link data — inferred from your browsing of other sites or collected from other sources — using a method knowns as “ID synching” or “cookie synching.” To do this, they match the tracker ID they have assigned to you with one or more tracker IDs that are held in another company’s database and that are likely also associated with you. Any of the linked trackers may have certain interests and other demographic information attributed to it. That information is then used to determine which ad to show you.Back to top

Content from https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/privacy-policy:

Last Updated on July 1, 2024
At The New York Times Company, our mission is to seek the truth and help people understand the world. We want you to understand how we handle your personal information. We also want you to know your rights and choices.
This policy describes how we handle your personal information when you use the following “Times Services”:
- The New York Times print newspaper, plus our print International Edition
- Our websites, like nytimes.com and its subdomains including The Athletic and Wirecutter
- Our apps, like The New York Times app and The New York Times Games app
- Our email newsletters, like Cooking and Morning Briefing
- Our pages or ads on social media networks, like our Facebook and Instagram pages
- Anywhere we gather information from or about you and refer you to this Privacy Policy
How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you use and how you use them. For example, we use different information about print subscribers than website visitors.
Be aware that certain Times Services work differently. Some have additional terms that supplement this policy (e.g., Reader Submissions).
If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at privacy@nytimes.com. You can also review our Privacy F.A.Q.

1. What Information Do We Gather About You?
The information we gather about you depends on the context. By and large, it’s information about you that can personally identify you — either on its own or when combined with other information.
The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.
1. (A) Information Collected through Times Services.
i. Information You Voluntarily Give Us
- For Registration:
When you sign up for a Times Service (whether via a subscription or a free account as a registered user), we collect personal identifiers such as your contact information, including your name and email address, and account credentials. We may also ask you to create an account name. Once you’re registered, we assign you a unique ID number. This ID number helps us recognize you when you’re signed in.
For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account. See Information Collected From Other Sources below.
If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information (e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions). Some events and conferences may have different or additional privacy policies and terms and we recommend that you review those before you register.
- For Billing:
To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information. This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.
- For User-Generated Content:
We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read (e.g., comments or recipe notes). Anyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts. See the Comments F.A.Q., the Cooking FAQ on writing personal or public notes on recipes, and read the User-Generated Content section in our Terms of Service for more information.
We do not have to publish any of your content. If the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your content, we will comply.
- For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers; Notice of Financial Incentives:
From time to time, we offer certain opportunities through contests, sweepstakes, or other special promotions and offers. When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.
Some such opportunities may allow you to earn “rewards” such as discounts (“Incentive Programs”). If this is part of the contest, sweepstake, promotion or offer, we will provide you with a full description of the Incentive Program, including the benefits offered and related legal terms. Because these Incentive Programs involve the collection of personal information, they may be interpreted as “financial incentive” programs under California law (or other similar concept under another law). We use this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy including for targeted advertising. We may share your personal information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, including data analytics providers, advertising technology vendors, and social media platforms.
The value of any financial incentive we offer is reasonably related to the value of any personal information you provide to us. We estimate the value of your personal information by considering, without limitation, the expenses we incur from collecting your personal information and/or providing the financial incentive to you, the revenue generated by your use of the financial incentive, and any improvements we can make to our products and Times Services based on information obtained through the financial incentive program.
Please note that we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive. If applicable, those terms will be presented to you at sign up. You may cancel your membership in such Incentive Programs at any time by contacting privacy@nytimes.com.
- For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs:
We gather personal information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs.
Surveys and Panels: Some of our surveys and feedback programs, including panels, will request your consent to provide on a purely voluntary basis information regarding your interests in various topics, including travel, entertainment and health and wellness, as well as demographic information, some of which may be considered sensitive under applicable laws such as your age, ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, family characteristics and income. We use service provider platforms to support these programs and personal information is shared with them as described below with respect to service providers in general.
We target these surveys based on a number of factors including information we automatically collect about your interests and usage, as described below. These surveys are used for a variety of purposes described throughout this Privacy Policy including research for marketing of Times Services, as well as research for third party advertisers that are interested in targeting ads to particular groups of Times readers.
As described in more detail below, we combine information from these surveys and panels with information collected automatically from Times Services and sometimes we also apply internal or third party machine learning or artificial intelligence large language models or applications to this information (alone or in combination with other personal information we collect about you). We do this for the purposes of improving Times Services, for marketing research, to personalize marketing of Times Services to you and/or to create audiences for third party advertisers.
Recording Your Feedback: With your consent, we may record interviews with you and ask for your permission to use your voice and likeness for a variety of purposes including marketing, advertising and/or Times events.
Reader Callouts: If you participate in a reader callout on Times Services, additional terms such as our Reader Submissions terms may apply (and will be posted where we ask you to participate).
- During Contact with Our Call Centers (Internal and Offshore):
We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers. This can include your name, contact information, information about your account and any other information you choose to provide.
- Personal Contacts Data/Refer-a-Friend:
We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.
With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances (e.g., Refer-a-Friend campaigns). This functionality is only meant for U.S. residents. By using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States — and that you have everyone’s consent for us to use their contact information.
If you’d like to invite your friends to use Times Services, we will store this information for the sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends referral offers, for determining whether your friends use Times Services after a referral is sent, and to remind your friends of the referral sent on your behalf.
iii. A Note about Sensitive Personal Information
We generally don’t want to gather sensitive personal information about you. This includes:
- Government-issued IDs (such as your driver’s license, passport or social security number)
- Your racial or ethnic origin
- Your political opinions
- Your religion or other beliefs
- Your health, biometric or genetic characteristics, including physical characteristics or descriptions
- Any trade union membership
- Your sexuality (information about your sex life or sexual orientation)
- Citizenship or immigration status
- Any criminal background
- The content of your private communications (other than messages you may send to us)
- Your precise geolocation (street level, GPS or lat/long data or other data that is derived from a device and that locates you within a geographic area that is equal to or less than the area of a circle with a radius of 1,850 feet). We sometimes collect precise geolocation information (which may be considered a sensitive data type) to provide GPS-based location services you choose to enable.
- Account access information, such as a username and password (we collect that information only for the accounts you create directly with us and not for any other account you may have with a third party in a personal capacity).
However, as explained in detail above in the section on “Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs,” there are situations when we request certain of the above information (e.g., a reader survey asks about your political leanings or ethnicity). You will always have the option to decline to answer or participate in such surveys, panels or other feedback programs. Outside these situations we would prefer you never share sensitive personal information with us.
iii. Information Collected Automatically
When you use Times Services, we collect some information automatically. The technologies we use to assist with this data collection include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts and software development kits (or SDKs). We may also use newer technologies, such as clean rooms, matching services described below (such as Unified ID 2.0 and LiveRamp’s Authenticated Traffic Solution) and Comscore’s Unified Digital Measurement (UDM) 2.0, as many browsers begin to deprecate third party cookies. We use these technologies on our digital properties, including our websites and apps, as well as in our email communications and newsletters. For more information about how to manage tracking methods on Times Services, read our Cookie Policy and the What Are Your Rights and Choices? section below.
The categories of personal information we collect automatically include:
- Identifiers and Device Information:
When you access our Times Services digitally, including our websites, apps, email communications and newsletters, our servers use a variety of technologies in order to automatically receive, record and/or log information about the device you are using, including unique identifiers. If your browser doesn’t accept our cookies or similar technologies, you can’t access certain parts of our websites (e.g., your account on nytimes.com). The items we collect include:
- Your IP address
- Cookie identifiers
- Your operating system and browser (e.g., type, version, and configuration)
- Your browser language
- Device identifiers (such as MAC address)
- Advertising identifiers
- The unique ID that we assign to you when you register, as described above
We combine this data with other information we collect about you.
- Geolocation Information:
Where applicable, we use location information such as your city, state, zip code, to personalize content provided to you, including, but not limited to, more relevant articles, newsletters, and weather updates. For more information, please read the Personalization F.A.Q. We also use location information such as zip code to show you prices and promotions, as explained in the discussion of Personalization below.
We may also provide you with the opportunity to share your location or other locations of interest to you in your User Profile in Account in order to have a personalized experience when visiting Times Services. Please do not provide us with street level or other location information that is more granular than city or zip code, we do not want to collect your precise geolocation information for this purpose, and that kind of information may be sensitive under applicable laws.
When you provide us your billing address as a subscriber, we use that information for compliance and/or payment purposes (e.g., to determine applicable notice requirements or to specify billing currency). We may also use your billing address to personalize content for you (e.g., news about weather at that location).
Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location if you enable this feature. Your GPS location is your precise geolocation, which (as noted above) is considered a type of sensitive personal information. You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the app. You can edit that setting on your device at any time. If you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app. If you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider’s servers — see below for the definition of service provider.
If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific app does not have location-based features, we don’t collect your precise GPS location. We do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location. Ads on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate location but are never targeted based on your GPS location.
- Other Usage Data:
We collect information about certain internet and network activity on Times Services, including your interactions with our websites and apps, such as the URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps, the URL of the website from which you came to our sites, how long you spent on a page, access times, search queries, and other details about your use of and actions on our Services. This also includes your interactions with marketing and advertisements on Times Services.
As described elsewhere in this Policy, we may use this usage data to personalize or customize content for you that we think you might like based on your usage patterns or for other similar purposes. We may also use it to improve the Times Services — for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Times Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Times Services interesting to as many users as possible. We also use this information to serve surveys or questionnaires based on your usage patterns. We combine this data with other information we collect about you.
1. (B) Inferences; Information We Create or Generate.
We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means such as machine learning, which may include third party machine learning services or large language models. These inferences include information about your likely preferences or other characteristics (e.g., article topics, writers, teams or markets of interest to you). As described below, we use these inferences for purposes of personalization, to improve our services, to market Times Services to you and to create audiences for third party advertisers and for marketing on other sites and services.
1. (C) Information Collected from Other Sources.
i. Privately Owned Databases:
Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information — like public data, survey data and more. This data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data. As described elsewhere in this Policy, including Section 2(G) below, we receive information about you from some of our service providers and third parties who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with Times Services, advertisements and communications.
ii. Social Media Platforms and Other Third-Party Services:
(Social media platforms include services like Instagram, Facebook, X, TikTok, Snap and other platforms. Third-party services include services like Google and Nook.)
If you provide your social network account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to Times Services through a third-party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts may be transmitted into your account with us.
You can link your social media or other third-party account to a Times Service. By linking that account, you authorize us to collect, store and use any information they may give us (e.g., your email address). You can disconnect your nytimes.com registration from third-party accounts at any time.
We also receive information from you when you interact with our pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms. This includes aggregate data on our followers (e.g., age, gender and location), engagement data (e.g., “likes,” comments, shares, reposts and clicks), awareness data (e.g., number of impressions and reach) and individual users’ public profiles.
For more information, refer to our social login and Nook F.A.Q.
iii. Workplace and Schools:
When your employer or school buys an organization-wide subscription to Times Services, they sometimes provide us with your name and organization email address to grant you access as a user.
2. What Do We Do with the Information We Collect about You?
We use each of the categories of personal information described above to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services, and for the following business and commercial purposes. The activities below can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (“service providers”) to whom we disclose your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy).
2. (A) We Provide the Times Services.
We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:
- Making a Times Service available to you or otherwise meeting or fulfilling the purposes for which you provided the information to us, including charging you for Times Services
- Arranging access to your account
- Providing customer service
- Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints
- Completing your payments and transactions
- Sending service-related transactional messages (e.g., a change in our Terms of Service, Terms of Sale, or other terms and conditions) and otherwise communicating with you about Times Services
- Saving your reading list, recipes or searches
- Displaying your Games (including Crossword, Wordle, Connections and Spelling Bee) stats
- Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments
- Creating and Managing user profiles and content.
2. (B) We Personalize Your Experience.
We track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize and calibrate your experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning, which may include third party machine learning services or large language models. This is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you’ve already read. For more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q and this blog post about how we personalize recipe recommendations. We also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you’ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data, including but not limited to location data such as IP address and zip code.
2. (C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.
Any information you disclose in your content becomes public — along with your chosen screen name or username and uploaded photo.
2. (D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.
We analyze data on our users’ subscriptions, purchases, registered account activity and other usage behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions. This allows us to understand how users interact with Times Services and to improve and develop Times Services, including testing new features, research, surveys, analysis, and product development.
For example, our analysis, which includes the use of technology like machine learning and large language models (proprietary or third party), lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services. It helps us determine whether our marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.
We use our own proprietary analytics services, but we also use third party analytics providers. Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use on certain Times Services. You can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.
2. (E) We Carry Out Administrative or Legal Tasks.
- For auditing, legal or regulatory purposes: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements. More broadly, we process information to comply with legal, regulatory and contractual obligations and to respond to law enforcement requests (our sharing for these purposes is described in Section 3 below).
- For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities, protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal, or harmful actions, and maintain the safety, security, and integrity of Times Services.
- For customer satisfaction: We assess users’ satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.
2. (F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.
As discussed above, you can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.
2. (G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers.
We gather data and work with service providers and third parties to show you and measure the performance of personalized ads on behalf of advertisers. This data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide (e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading and account activity history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information.
For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on your visit to nytimes.com and other sites. You can opt out of the use of certain Google cookies by visiting the related Google privacy policy.
You can find a list of some of the service providers and third parties with whom we work here.
We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers. To do this, we combine information we collect through surveys or registration with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps. This combined information is used to build models. These data models are then used to measure users’ attributes, like their demographic information or their interests. Working with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes. Each group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our sites and apps.
We may also target third party advertising to users through matching services such as Unified ID 2.0 and LiveRamp’s Authenticated Traffic Solution (“ATS”). In these situations, we use information that directly identifies you, including name, email address, or phone number, to engage in targeted advertising, including by converting email addresses/phone numbers into identifiers used for advertising purposes. We share information that we collect from you, such as your email, IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers, including LiveRamp Inc. LiveRamp returns an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. You can read more about LiveRamp’s privacy practice here.
We may also collect such information (name, email, IP address, phone number and/or information about your browser or operating system) from third parties for the purposes of personalized marketing to you on Times Services and/or to create audiences for third-party advertisers.
For more information about your choices with respect to such processing, please see the What Are Your Rights and Choices? section below.
Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations. Times Services like Wirecutter may include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us. These vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor’s URL, we may earn a commission.
Additional Notes:
- For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the DAA Webchoices Browser Check and NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising. You can download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps. You can also follow the instructions in the What Are Your Rights and Choices? section below.
- We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you. Many of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own. Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.
- These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads; check their privacy policies for more details. For further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable Cookie Policy. As described in more detail below, California residents have the right to instruct us not to “sell” or “share” their personal information. Residents of Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia have the right to opt out of “targeted advertising” and "sales" (as defined under applicable law). For more information, please see the What Are Your Rights and Choices? section below.
2. (H) We Advertise or Market Times Services to You.
We market our Times Services to you. Sometimes we use marketing vendors to do this. For example, when you visit Times Services, the Google Dynamic Floodlight tag collects data through redirects of requests from your browser to entities other than Times Services, Google, and the owner or operator of other properties on which The Times may serve marketing using Google.
We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties. Often these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed to or purchased anything. The ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers. We use the information described in Section 1 above, including inferences, to build audiences that may be used for purposes of these marketing initiatives. We may also make predictions using machine learning, as described above, based on a combination of different kinds of information, including survey data, to support these marketing initiatives.
We also target our advertising of Times Services to users by uploading a customer list (email addresses) to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service. The third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data.
We will take steps designed to opt you out of such matched ads if you are a resident of certain states where you have the right to opt out of such processing, as discussed further below. That being said, in order to opt out of receiving these matched ads, you should also contact the applicable third parties. For example, when we use “Custom Audiences” to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out. We are not responsible for any third party’s failure to comply with opt-out requests. To opt out of Unified ID 2.0 (or UID 2), please visit https://www.transparentadvertising.com/.
We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails. For information on opting out of these emails, see What Are Your Rights and Choices? below.
2. (I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information into Larger Findings.
Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, as defined under applicable laws. This helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create audiences for advertising or marketing interest-based segments or compile survey results. We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.
3. To Whom Do We Disclose or Share the Information We Gather for Business and Commercial Purposes?
3. (A) Within The New York Times Company:
Our affiliates may access your information for the purposes listed here. Our affiliates include the companies on this list.
3. (B) With Service Providers:
We work with service providers, as defined above, to carry out certain tasks, including the following business purposes:
- Processing your payments
- Fulfilling your orders
- Maintaining technology and related infrastructure
- Offering you customer service
- Serving and targeting ads and measuring ad performance (including counting ad impressions of unique visitors, verifying positioning and quality of ad impressions and auditing compliance with these specifications and other standards)
- Presenting surveys
- Shipping you products and mailings
- Distributing emails
- List processing and analytics
- Managing and analyzing research
- Managing promotions
- Detecting security incidents, protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and debugging to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your personal information.
We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws.
3. (C) With Other Third Parties:
There are situations when we disclose your information to third parties beyond our service providers. For example, as discussed above in Section 2(G) and (H), we share your email address and other personal information with third parties both for marketing of Times Services across third party sites and services, and to support matching for third party advertising on Times Services. Those emails may or may not be hashed when they are shared with third parties.
It is worth noting how practices of certain vendors and changes in law outside of our control have changed what we can say about this. First, as noted elsewhere in this Policy, to the extent regulators take the position that the disclosure of information for matched ads is a “sale,” we will take steps designed to opt you out of such matched ads if you are a resident of an applicable jurisdiction and you exercise your right not to have your personal information “sold.” As noted above, you may also have to contact certain third parties to opt out of such matched ads.
Second, at least one of our vendors uses pseudonymized email addresses they receive from us to power products that they provide to us and their other customers. Therefore, it is possible that your email address, which was shared with our vendor to provide services to us, is being used in pseudonymized form by the vendor to provide products and services to other companies.
While we try to control the behavior of our vendors that we understand to be service providers, some of those vendors engage in activities beyond our control that may be seen by a regulator as the activities of “third parties,” not service providers.
The following provides more information about the circumstances in which we know we are disclosing personal information to third parties that are not service providers.
i. If you’re a U.S. print subscriber, we may provide your name and mailing address (among other information) to other companies that want to market to you by mail. This may be a “sale” of personal information under the law of some jurisdictions. If you prefer we don’t share this information, refer below to What Are Your Rights and Choices? below.
ii. We provide information to third party advertisers and their agencies as described in Section 2(G) above. With the evolution of advertising technology, and the deprecation of third-party cookies, our advertising business is also changing and we share your first party data with advertisers and their agencies in some cases.
iii. We provide information to websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties in connection with marketing, as described in Section 2(H) above.
iv. We provide information about our live event and conference attendees (e.g., your name, your company or your job title) to the event sponsors. In those cases, we notify you when you provide us the information.
v. We provide information about participants in our sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions to the promotions’ sponsors. In those cases, we notify you when you provide us the information.
vi. We process payments you make through Times Services with external services. There are two ways this can happen:
- We collect your information and provide it to the third-party service for processing (such as Worldpay).
- The third-party service collects your information for processing.
vii. In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we would have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your information to a third party — such as an acquiring entity and its advisers.
viii. We can preserve or disclose personal information if the law requires us to do so. We can also preserve or disclose personal information if we believe it would be necessary to:
- Comply with the law or with legal process
- Protect and defend our rights and property
- Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Times Services
- Protect the safety or property of our personnel, users or the general public (e.g., if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, we could share your information to help investigations into your actions)
- Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside your country of residence.
ix. We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. Your public activities could thus appear on other websites, blogs or feeds. As described above in the section on user-generated content, information that you make public will be shared with other users, including user profile information. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through Times Services, and other users may be able to contact you through messages and comments.
x. If you use a promotional or discount code that you receive from another company in order to purchase Times Services, we will share the fact that you redeemed that code with that third party company.
As described above in Section 2(I), we may disclose aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.
4. What Are Your Rights and Choices?
We provide a variety of ways for you to control the personal information we hold about you, including choices about how we use that information. In some jurisdictions, these controls and choices are enforceable as rights under applicable law. The choices described below are limited to the specific email address, phone or device used. They won’t affect different email addresses, phones or devices used, or subsequent subscriptions.
4. (A) In General
i. Communications Preferences

To stop receiving emails and email newsletters sent directly by The Athletic, you must separately manage your communications preferences on your The Athletic settings page or contact The Athletic.
- Mail or Telephone Promotions:
You can ask us to unsubscribe from our mail or telephone solicitations. In some jurisdictions, as discussed elsewhere in this Policy, you can also ask us to not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes. To do so, call us at 1-800-698-4637 or chat with us. You may also email us at privacy@nytimes.com with “Opt Out” in the subject line and your account number and phone number in the body of the email.

- Text Messages:
You can opt out of text alerts any time by replying “STOP,” or any alternative keyword we’ve shared with you.
We complete any opt-out request as quickly as we can. This opt-out request won’t prohibit us from sending you important nonmarketing notices.
ii. Access, Correct, Change/Update, Delete or Restrict Processing of Your Personal Information
In some jurisdictions, you may exercise the following choices:
- Access, modify or delete the personal information we have about you
- Be informed of or receive an electronic copy of the personal information we have about you, for data portability.
- Restrict, or object to, how we process personal information about you
For example, in the European Union and the United Kingdom, you have the right to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of your personal information under certain circumstances; and where the processing is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw that consent at any time for future processing.
If you’d like to exercise any of the above choices, contact us via this form or by calling us at our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES. In order to exercise your choices for The Athletic, click here or contact privacy@theathletic.com. In your request, please be specific. State the information you want changed, whether you’d like your information suppressed from our database or whether there are limitations you’d like us to put on how we use your personal information. Please use the email address linked to that personal information — we only complete requests on the information linked to your email address. To verify your identity, we will email the email address you provide us and wait for your response. In some instances, we may also ask for additional information. This is how we verify your identity before complying. If you use Times Services without creating an account and signing in, there may be no reasonable means by which we can verify your identity or the personal information related to you.
In some jurisdictions, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to do that, please provide the agent with written permission, signed by you, authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf. The agent must submit that written permission along with the request. We may contact you to verify your identity — and the authorized agent’s permission — before a response to the request is sent.
We’ll respond to your request in a manner consistent with applicable law, including any exceptions that may result in a request being denied in whole or in part.
We might need to keep certain information for recordkeeping purposes, or to complete a transaction you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., if you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you might not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of the purchase or promotion).
In some cases, your request doesn’t ensure complete removal of the content or information.
iii. Managing Your Digital and Home Delivery Accounts
You can update your account information and see your transaction history (if you are an International Edition print subscriber, use this link instead). If you need assistance, call our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES. Other local numbers are available.
Managing your account information works differently if you subscribed via Apple’s App Store or Google Play. Please register with us to access the Account area and contact Apple or Google for your transaction history.
iv. Browser and Platform Controls
- Cookie Controls:
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our websites. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated. For more information, read our Cookie Policy.
In certain jurisdictions, you may also be able to manage your cookie preferences through our consent management platform.
- Global Privacy Control:
Some browsers and browser extensions support the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data "sales" as defined under certain laws. In certain territories, when we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by a GPC setting as required by applicable law.
- Do Not Track:
Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Unlike the GPC described above, there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal; therefore, our websites do not respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.
- Mobile Advertising ID Controls:
iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.
- Email Web Beacons:
Most email clients have settings which allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web beacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.
- LiveRamp ATS:
To opt out of LiveRamp’s ATS, described in greater detail above, please click here.
v. Opt Out of Targeted Advertising and “Sales or Sharing” of Personal Information
Residents of certain jurisdictions, including Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia, have the right to opt out of targeted advertising and "sales or sharing" (as defined under applicable law) of their personal information. If you are in one of those jurisdictions, in order to exercise your right to opt out of targeted advertising or "sales" of your personal information, please click on the “Your Privacy Choices” link at the bottom of the webpage where your information is being collected or go to “Account” and then “Settings,” and “Privacy Settings” and click the “Your Privacy Choices” link there. California residents can review relevant information relating to California privacy laws below.
vi. Delete My Account
You have the ability to delete your registered user account in New York Times native apps and on the web at nytimes.com/account, and separately in The Athletic’s app. If you delete your registered user account in the New York Times native apps or on the web at nytimes.com/account, we will delete you from our registered user database and remove you from our email marketing and newsletter lists. If you delete your registered user account in The Athletic’s app, we will delete you from our registered user database, however you will need to separately unsubscribe from The Athletic’s emails and email newsletters as explained in Section 4(A)(i) above. If you are a subscriber, you will need to cancel any active subscriptions and wait for their benefits to end before deleting your account. Even if you have never created a separate account with The Athletic, it is possible that The Athletic has created such an account for you. You must take additional steps to delete that separate account with The Athletic even if you delete your New York Times account.
vii. Other Rights and Choices
You will not receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights.
This Policy has been designed to be accessible to people with disabilities. If you experience difficulties accessing this Policy, please contact us at privacy@nytimes.com. If you’d like, you can lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. A list of E.U. data protection authorities is available. But we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
In some jurisdictions, you may appeal to us if we refuse to take action on your exercise of certain choices described above. In order to appeal such a refusal, please contact us at privacy@nytimes.com using the subject line “Appeal of Refusal to Take Action on Privacy Request” and provide the relevant information in the email.
4. (B) California Privacy Notices and Rights
If you are a California resident, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information.
i. Notice at Collection and Notice of Financial Incentives
At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is "sold or shared" as defined under California law and how long such information is retained. You can find those details in this Privacy Policy by clicking on the above links.
For the Notice of Financial Incentives, see Section 1(A)(i) above.
ii. Rights to Know, Correction and Deletion
You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information. Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. Under the CCPA, these rights are subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your personal information to provide you with Times Services or to complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your request.
Please see Access, Correct, Change/Update, Delete, or Restrict Processing of Your Personal Information above for details, including on how to exercise these rights and how we verify your identity.
iii. “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”
To the extent The New York Times Company “sells” your personal information (as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA), you have the right to opt-out of that “sale” on a going-forward basis at any time.
If you’re a California resident, you have a right to opt-out from the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information with third parties who are not our service providers (as those terms are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, or “CCPA” for short in this Policy). To exercise this right, click the "Your Privacy Choices" link on the bottom of the webpage where your information is being collected or go to “Account” and then “Settings,” and “Privacy Settings” and click the “Your Privacy Choices” link there. You can also submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at privacy@nytimes.com with the subject line “California Resident - Do Not Sell or Share.” Finally, if your browser supports it, you can turn on the Global Privacy Control to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information.
If you have an account with certain Times Services (specifically nytimes.com, cooking.nytimes.com, nytimes.com/crosswords, the New York Times app, the New York Times Cooking app and the New York Times Games app) and are logged in, we will save your preference and honor your opt-out request across browsers and devices so long as you remain logged in. If you are not logged in, or do not have an account with any Times Services listed above, your opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information will be specific to the browser or device from which you have clicked “Your Privacy Choices” and until you clear your cookies (or local storage in apps) on this browser or device.
We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined by the CCPA) the personal information of minors under 16 years old.
iv. Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
If you are a California resident, you have a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law. To opt-out from such additional purposes, contact us via this form or by calling us at our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES. To opt-out from such additional purposes from The Athletic, contact us via this form.
v. Authorized Agents
You can designate an authorized agent to make a request to exercise your rights under the CCPA on your behalf. In order to do that, please provide the agent with written permission, signed by you, authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf. The agent must submit that written permission along with the request. We may contact you to verify your identity — and the authorized agent’s permission — before a response to the request is sent.
vi. Non-Discrimination Rights
You may exercise any of your rights listed in this section without fear of unlawful discrimination.
vii. Record of Requests
We keep a record of requests that we received from California residents.
For data deletion and data access requests, our readers submit requests through our intake form. In the intake form, they mark whether they reside in California. We then send an identity verification email to the user. If the user does not verify their identity in 45 days, their request will be denied. If the user does verify in 45 days, we begin to fulfill their request.
We have calculated our median process time for verified data deletion and data access requests. Any requests completed within the same day are rounded to one day. The median process time is found by organizing the processing time of each verified request from lowest to highest. The middle number is the median.

viii. California “Shine the Light” Privacy Rights
Under the California “Shine the Light” law, California residents can opt out of our sharing of their information to third parties (and sometimes affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes. We do not generally disclose your personal information as specifically defined in the Shine the Light law. To the extent we share your email address with a third party in connection with online marketing in a way that might be covered by Shine the Light, you may opt out of such sharing by visiting the Your Privacy Choices link in the footer of our websites or in your mobile app settings.
To make a “Shine the Light” request to The Athletic, please submit a written request to privacy@theathletic.com.
ix. Removal of Content for California Minors
If you’re a California resident under 18 years old and you’re registered with a Times Service, you can ask us to remove content or information you’ve posted to a Times Service. Email us at privacy@nytimes.com with “California Under 18 Content Removal Request” in the subject line and tell us what you want removed. We will make reasonable efforts to remove the post from public view, although we cannot ensure the complete removal of the content and may retain the content as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
5. How Long Do You Retain Data?
We store your personal information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law). This means we might retain your personal information even after you close your account with us.
When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:
- How long we have had a relationship with you or provided a Times Service to you
- Whether we are subject to any legal obligations (e.g., any laws that require us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time before we can delete them)
- Whether we have taken any legal positions (e.g., in connection with any statutes of limitation)
Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying details.
6. How Do You Protect My Information?
We protect your personal information with appropriate organizational, technological and physical safeguards — but we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We recommend that you use complex and unique passwords for your Times accounts and for third-party accounts linked to them. Do not share your password with anyone.
If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure, notify us immediately.
7. Are There Guidelines for Children?
Times Services are intended for a general audience and are not directed at children under (13) years of age.
We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us at privacy@nytimes.com. We will remove the data to the extent required by applicable laws.
8. How Is Information Transferred Internationally?
The New York Times Company is headquartered in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States — or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.
If we transfer your data out of the European Economic Area (E.E.A.), the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland, we implement at least one of the three following safeguards:
- We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to E.E.A. standards (see the full list of these countries).
- We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by contractual obligations, including E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses together with addenda or language to cover the UK and/or Switzerland, as applicable, and additional safeguards to protect your personal data. You can see a copy of these clauses.
- We confirm that the service provider to which we are transferring data has an active self-certification under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF, as applicable.
In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.
9. What Is Our Legal Basis?
In some jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we only collect, use or share information about you when we have a valid reason. This is called a “lawful basis.” Specifically, this is one of the following:
- The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your information
- The performance of the contract we have with you
- The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject, or
- The legitimate interests of The Times or a third party. “Legitimate interest” is a technical term under international laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests. “Legitimate interest” also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact.
We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure; (2) to administer and generally conduct business within The New York Times Company; (3) to prevent fraud; and (4) to conduct our marketing activities.
10. What about Third-Party Services?
Some Times Services contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors and advertisers. These third parties are not Times Services. Additionally, Times Services may be available to you through third-party digital properties such as Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). We do not control (and are not responsible for) third party content or privacy practices. These third parties may independently collect and solicit information about you and affect your data preferences when you access the Times Services on third-party digital properties (see “Additional Notes” below for more information). Any personal information you provide to them is not covered by this Privacy Policy. These third parties have their own policies and practices about data, which may include what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and terms of use.
Additional Notes
- As mentioned above, some Times Services are offered on third-party digital properties (such as third-party websites, frameworks, and domains) which can affect our data practices and your data preferences. For example, we use Google AMP to help Times Services load quickly on mobile devices. We also use third-party properties to facilitate other Times Services, such as our Live Events.
- If you set your data preferences while using one of these third-party digital properties, your preferences will only be saved with respect to the Times Services on that specific third-party digital property. Your preferences will not carry over when you use the Times Services on The Times’s own digital properties. And, your preferences will only be saved on Google AMP and other third-party digital properties until your cookies are cleared. Once your cookies are cleared, you will need to reset your data preferences for each third-party digital property used to access Times Services.
- If your browser settings allow for cross-site tracking (e.g., allows for trackers to follow your preferences across websites), you can set your preferences on The Times’s digital properties so that your preferences will be remembered when you access the Times Services through Google AMP. However, if your browser settings do not allow for cross-site tracking, your preferences on The Times’s own digital properties will not carry over to the Times Services you access through Google AMP.
- If you are an European resident and you do not accept trackers (other than essential trackers) while using Times Services on AMP, you will be served non-personalized ads. If you do not accept trackers (other than essential trackers) while using the Times Services on The Times’s digital properties, you will receive The Times house ads or no ads at all.
11. How Are Changes to this Privacy Policy Communicated?
We are always improving our products and services, and we create new features regularly. These updates sometimes require us to collect new information or use what we already have differently. Further, the laws regarding personal information and privacy frequently change. As a result, we must periodically update this Privacy Policy.
We will post any changes on this page by updating this policy. If we make a significant or material change in the way we collect, use or share your personal information, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to the changes taking effect. We will do this via email or prominent notice within Times Services. If you object to any change, you can stop using the Times Services.
After we post any changes on this page, your continued use of Times Services is subject to the updated Privacy Policy.

Liz Cheney Endorses Kamala Harris
The former congresswoman and Republican exile campaigned with the vice president in the battleground state of Wisconsin.
I tell you, I have never voted for a Democrat. But this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. I know that she will be a president who will defend the rule of law. And I know that she will be a president who can inspire all of our children and, if I might say so, especially our little girls. We have a shared commitment, a shared commitment as Americans to ensuring that future generations live in a nation where power is transferred peacefully, where our leaders are men and women of good faith, and where our public servants set aside partisan battles to do what’s right for this country.
Liz Cheney Endorses Kamala Harris

What we like: A staff-favorite simple, inexpensive solution to keep your purse or backpack from coming into contact with dirt, water, and germs. From our guide to items for hybrid office workers. Works with different types of surface edges and thicknesses, from a table to the top of a bathroom-stall door to a handrail.

5 Cheap(ish) Things for Hybrid Office Workers
- Buy from Amazon
Best for
Real Techniques Artist Essentials Makeup Brush Set
$10
$17Save $7
What we like: Our best-value pick in our guide to the best makeup brushes. Unparalleled for the price. Bristles are matte and grippy, the weighted metallic handles feel high-quality, and the dome shapes are unique and sculptural. The brand never outright beat more expensive options in our testing, but always ranked well with our testers.
Other things to know: We recommend buying brushes individually, but think this set is your best bet even it may be too specialized for many people. Includes an expert edge brush for foundation and contour, a smudge liner brush, an accent brush for blending blush and highlighter, a lip smudge brush, and a spotlight fan.
Top pick

- Buy from Nordstrom

What we like: Our top eyelash curler pick. Curls lashes without crimping. Thoughtful hinged design reduced skin pinching and tearing out eyelashes better than any other curlers we tested. Compatible with different eye shapes. Lasting results.
Other things to know: Higher build quality at a lower price than similar high-end models. Includes a replacement curling pad. Use code FRIEND to get deal at Macy's. Free shipping for Macy's Star Rewards members (free to join).

Cuisinart CDF-200 Deep Fryer
$72
$100Save $28
- Buy from Kohl's Free Kohl's account required, use promo codes SAVEBIG10 and GET10
What we like: Our top deep fryer pick. Consistently produced perfectly crunchy, golden-brown food in our tests. Best for anyone who fries a lot of food or wants a standalone machine for parties. Reliable thermostat maintained the set oil temperature. Also features clearly labeled temperature-control dial, wind-up 30-minute timer, and spacious frying basket.
Other things to know: None of the deep fryers we tested could maintain a set temperature as well as a pot of oil over a gas range. The fryer lid window is pretty useless. Has a lot of parts that require cleaning. Free Kohl's account required, use promo codes SAVEBIG10 and GET10.

What we like: Our top stylus pick for drawing on the newest iPad Air and Pro models. Fully supports pressure sensitivity, which makes drawing feel natural. Includes all of the 2nd-gen Pencil’s features and adds haptic feedback, plus “squeeze” and “barrel roll” functionality.
Other things to know: Works exclusively with brand-new M2 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro tablets. Squeeze and barrel roll functions are cool, but not many apps take advantage of them yet. About 12 hours of battery life on a single charge.

Other things to know: After our long-term capacity tests, all our picks had less than their rated capacity left—though not by much. Deal is for a pack of eight. Clip on-page coupon to get deal price.

- Buy from Ulta With store pickup
What we like: A face wash guest pick recommended in our piece on The Bachelorette executive producer and showrunner Claire Freeland's travel essentials. This gentle, fragrance-free face wash is the first step of Freeland’s low-maintenance skin-care routine while on the road.
Other things to know: One of the better deals we've seen for the 5-ounce tube. Choose store pickup to avoid shipping fees.

- Buy from Kohl's Use promo code SAVEBIG20, with store pickup
What we like: Our budget electric kettle pick. A study, no-frills kettle that gets the job done. Easy to hold handle. Spout doesn't drip when pouring. Heated water just as quickly as our top pick and shuts off automatically as soon as it reaches a boil.
Other things to know: Lacks audible boiled water alert. No preset temperature controls or keep-warm setting. Flimsy plastic lid hinges. Limited one-year manufacturer's warranty. Recurring deal price. Use code SAVEBIG20, with store pickup.

- Buy from Kohl's Use promo codes SAVEBIG20 and GET10, with store pickup
What we like: This 4-cup chopper is our pick for the best mini food processor. Dices well and is more roomy than other options we tested. Two holes for frustration-free drizzling. Button design is similar to that of full-size food processors, making it easy to operate.
Other things to know: A mini chopper won’t replace a full-size model. Struggles to effectively dice herbs, tearing rather than cutting cleanly and evenly. Use promo codes SAVEBIG20 and GET10, select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.

- Buy from Kohl's Use promo code SAVEBIG20, with store pickup
What we like: An extra freezer bowl insert associated with our top ice cream maker pick. Having an extra freezer bowl for your Cuisinart ICE-21 ice cream maker would allow you to make two batches of ice cream back-to-back because you need to pre-freeze the bowls.
Other things to know: 1½-quart capacity. Use code SAVEBIG20 and opt for store pickup.

Cuisinart ICE-21 Ice Cream Maker
$48
$65Save $17
- Buy from Kohl's Free Kohl's account required, use promo codes SAVEBIG10 and GET10, with store pickup
What we like: Our top pick for the best ice cream maker. Made some of the smoothest and most delicious ice cream in our tests. More affordable than a compressor model. Churns ice cream faster than our other picks, reaching soft-serve consistency in about 18 minutes.
Other things to know: Bowl insert must be pre-frozen overnight, which requires planning. If you want to make multiple batches in a row, extra bowl inserts are sold separately. Free Kohl's account and store pickup required to get deal price. Use codes BIGSAVE20 and GET10.
- Buy from Kohl's
Top pick
Cuisinart CPT-122 2-Slice Compact Plastic Toaster
$24
$30Save $6
- Buy from Kohl's Use promo code BIGSAVE20, with store pickup
What we like: Our longtime top pick for the best two-slot toaster. Produced the most evenly browned bread during our tests. Wide variety of settings and easy-to-use controls. Deep, wide slots for thick-cut bagels. "High lift" feature on lever allows you to lift out smaller items, like English muffins, without burning your fingertips.
Other things to know: Three-year warranty. Plastic body and levers don't look quite as nice as a metal finish. Heating element wires of modern toasters are subject to corrosion over time. Use code BIGSAVE20. Select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.

- Buy from Kohl's Use promo code BIGSAVE20, with store pickup
What we like: Our budget waffle maker pick. Makes consistently excellent waffles quickly. Compact design is perfect for small spaces. This model is a good choice only if you like your waffles thin and crispy and don’t need to make many at once.
Other things to know: Produces one thin, round American-style waffle at a time (think Eggo). Hardware feels cheaper than that of our other picks. Use code BIGSAVE20, opt for store pickup to avoid shipping fees.
- Buy from Kohl's
Top pick
Vinci Hands-Free Electric Citrus Juicer
$72
$100Save $28
- Buy from Kohl's Free Kohl's account required, use promo codes SAVEBIG10 and GET10
What we like: Our top electric citrus juicer pick. Quickly produced more juice than most electric models we tested. Just load fruit onto the juicing cone, snap the lid shut, push a button, and voilà—you have juice. A favorite among our paid testers for accessibility, ease of use, and wow factor.
Other things to know: Lid was tough to close on larger grapefruits. Expensive, but out-performed even pricier models. Bulky, with a large counter top footprint. Apply coupons SAVEBIG10 and GET10 at checkout. Free Kohl's account required.

What we like: Our top pick waffle maker. Consistently churns out lofty, golden Belgian waffles that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Waffles cook in two minutes and pop out without resistance. Handle remains cool enough to touch while the machine is in use.
Other things to know: A green light indicates when the waffle maker is preheated or finished cooking—there's no audible alert. Tallest of our picks, but low enough profile to clear the underside of a cabinet while open on the countertop. Deal price with promo codes SAVEBIG20 and GET10 with store pickup when signed in at Kohl's.

The Best Air Purifier
Tim Heffernan is a writer who covers air and water quality and sustainable-energy technology. He prefers Flare-brand match smoke for purifier testing.
Air purifiers are fundamentally simple machines—little more than a fan and a filter. Yet a well-designed purifier can capture virtually all airborne allergens, such as pollen and mold spores, as well as bacteria, viruses, and smoke.
We’ve tested more than 60 air purifiers in the past nine years, and the exceptional Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty is our top pick among them. It’s powerful enough to clean a large room, quiet enough to sleep near, engineered to run for years, and inexpensive enough to set up several throughout a home. But it’s not the only excellent air purifier we’ve found, and if you prefer the looks, price, or features of our other recommendations, be assured that they are also top-notch performers.
Everything we recommend
Top pick
Perfect for bedrooms, playrooms, and living rooms, this purifier is one of the highest-performing, most-durable, and most-economical models we’ve tested.
Runner-up
Virtually identical to our top pick on features and performance, this purifier is a great choice if you prefer its looks or find it at a better price.
Also great
This purifier is terrific overall, but it has minor shortcomings, including a stark look, no display shutoff, and slightly elevated electrical use.
Also great
With quiet operation, good color options, and performance matching our other picks, this is a great choice, although the cost of filter replacements can run relatively high.
Also great
Similar in performance to other purifiers its size, the Levoit impressed in initial and long-term testing.
Upgrade pick
The Blue Pure 211i Max aced our tests, and on top of its powerful performance, it stands out for its energy efficiency, quiet operation, user-friendly features, and good looks.
Budget pick
Not much bigger than a 3-liter soda bottle, this quiet, energy-efficient purifier is a good choice for dorm rooms, offices, or children’s bedrooms.
Top pick
Perfect for bedrooms, playrooms, and living rooms, this purifier is one of the highest-performing, most-durable, and most-economical models we’ve tested.
Within 30 minutes, the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty reduced heavy smoke pollution in a New York City office by as much as 99.6%; this is comparable to the performance of other top machines and has been consistent in multiple test spaces. We’ve pushed this machine beyond its on-paper limits in various ways—including running its filters 24/7 for two years, twice as long as recommended—and it has never wavered or weakened. It offers great value on initial and long-term costs, and its compact form, quiet operation, and display-light shutoff make it especially well suited to using it in a bedroom or living room.
Runner-up
Virtually identical to our top pick on features and performance, this purifier is a great choice if you prefer its looks or find it at a better price.
The Coway Airmega 200M is virtually identical to Coway’s Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty in every important respect. They’re equivalent in noise and performance measurements, their filters are interchangeable, and their similar controls allow you to shut off the display lights. The 200M has a square grille rather than a round one, but that’s the only major physical difference. If you prefer the 200M’s looks or you find it at a better price, we recommend it.
Also great
This purifier is terrific overall, but it has minor shortcomings, including a stark look, no display shutoff, and slightly elevated electrical use.
The Winix 5500-2 is an exceptional performer on particulates air pollution: It captured as much as 99.9% of the smoke in our test room in just 30 minutes on high. We prefer the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty for its lower energy consumption, smaller visual footprint, and manual display-shutoff feature. The related 5300-2 and C535 (which is exclusive to the Winix store and Walmart) lack a few of the 5500-2’s features, but they perform just as well and may be available at lower prices. We’ve had similarly strong results with every other Winix we’ve tested, including the AM80 and Wi-Fi–enabled AM90—not surprising given that the only meaningful differences between them are their looks.
Also great
With quiet operation, good color options, and performance matching our other picks, this is a great choice, although the cost of filter replacements can run relatively high.
The Blueair Blue Pure 311i Max is similarly excellent in purifying performance to our other standard-space picks and offers notably quiet performance, terrific energy efficiency, and a display shutoff. A re-engineered motor (versus its predecessor, the 311 Auto), a larger and less dense filter, and a more-open outlet grille account for its lower electricity consumption and noise output. The Blueair app lets you monitor your air quality and adjust the machine’s settings remotely. And it’s a particularly attractive machine, with a tweed-like, washable cover available in several muted colors. One minor knock: The company recommends replacing the filters every six to nine months, pushing yearly replacement costs above those of some similar purifiers.
Also great
Similar in performance to other purifiers its size, the Levoit impressed in initial and long-term testing.
Levoit’s Vital 200S matched the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty in performance tests, and the two are very similar in terms of energy efficiency, noise output, and an ability to shut off the display while maintaining the fan setting of your choosing. It’s been working flawlessly in our first year of long-term testing in a New York City apartment.
Upgrade pick
The Blue Pure 211i Max aced our tests, and on top of its powerful performance, it stands out for its energy efficiency, quiet operation, user-friendly features, and good looks.
The Blueair Blue Pure 211i Max, meant for large spaces around 500 square feet, is a stellar performer, reducing smoke levels in our test room by more than 99.9% on its high and high-medium settings. In spite of the power, it’s extremely energy efficient and quieter than you’d expect. You can shut off the display while it runs, which helps if you’re light sensitive while trying to sleep. There’s a child lock for the controls. Its air-quality sensor reads your room’s particulate-pollution levels at 1, 2.5, and 10 microns (aka PM1, PM2.5, and PM10—broadly equivalent to smoke, dust, and pollen). An app remotely monitors its readings and can control its settings. It’s priced accordingly, and if you’re considering this for a small to medium room, you can get more than ample purifying performance for at least $100 less with our other picks.
Budget pick
Not much bigger than a 3-liter soda bottle, this quiet, energy-efficient purifier is a good choice for dorm rooms, offices, or children’s bedrooms.
The diminutive Blueair Blue Pure 511 has many of the same features that we like in the other Blue Pure purifiers we recommend. It’s a great performer for a machine of its size and power. In our testing, it cleared 96.9% of smoke particles in half an hour on its highest setting, and it cleared 89.6% on medium. It’s also extremely quiet, staying below our 50-decibel limit for comfortable TV viewing and sleeping, even on high. Drawing just 3.5 watts on its everyday medium speed, it’s very energy-efficient, too. At less than 4 pounds, it can easily be placed on a shelf or a desk, as well as on the floor. And its display goes dark automatically, so this machine won’t be a distraction when you’re trying to nap or work.
Below, we also recommend a purifier specifically for reducing VOCs. However, due to its many drawbacks, it’s strictly for special cases, where simply opening a window isn’t an option.

Why you should trust us
Since 2017, I have conducted extensive reporting on and real-world testing of air purifiers in my New York City apartment and in Wirecutter’s New York and Los Angeles offices. I have spoken with manufacturers, engineers, academics, and experts. And I have also lived with most of our picks, running them 24/7 for months—and sometimes years—in my apartment.
That experience has helped me gather objective data on their long-term purifying performance and any mechanical degradation. It has also helped me make informed judgments on factors such as ease of maintenance and operation, the presence or lack of distracting noises or lights, and simple visual impact—the so-called little things that, if done incorrectly, can turn what should be a nearly set-it-and-forget-it appliance into a daily annoyance.
Who this is for
If you suffer from allergies or simply have concerns about the air quality in your home, a HEPA air purifier can help. These devices do just one thing, but they do it very well: remove fine particles from the air. They rapidly and permanently capture most common airborne allergens, including dust and pollen; mold, mildew, and fungal spores; pet dander; and dust mites and their excrement. They’re also excellent at reducing smoke from wildfires, tobacco, and marijuana. They also capture airborne pathogens—bacteria as well as most, if not all, viruses, including the coronavirus. These machines are pretty easy to live with, but for the full story, read this piece on How to Set Up an Air Purifier.
Once particulate matter settles on floors or other surfaces, an air purifier won’t lift it up. To clean allergens like pet hair and pollen from surfaces, you need a vacuum cleaner or a dust mop. To reduce viruses and bacteria on surfaces, it is usually sufficient to clean them with soap, detergent, or an all-purpose cleaner.
How we picked
Air purifiers generally fall into three categories: those designed for small spaces (such as kids’ bedrooms, dorm rooms, and offices), those intended for general living spaces (such as enclosed living rooms and master bedrooms), and those designed for large spaces (including combined living/dining rooms and areas with cathedral ceilings).
The problem is that many manufacturers dramatically overstate their machines’ abilities. A lot of “living room” purifiers are barely powerful enough to keep a walk-in closet clear.
We begin by calculating projected airflow abilities. When considering a new purifier, we first refer to manufacturer-supplied specs on airflow (usually given as a clean air delivery rate, or CADR). We compute the air changes per hour, or ACH, they can provide in hypothetical rooms of 150, 350, and 500 square feet (assuming an 8-foot ceiling height).
We set four ACH as the minimum for a purifier to be considered adequate for each room size. Based on our years of real-world testing, we know that four ACH ensures rapid and nearly complete cleaning of highly polluted air.
We usually choose purifiers with true HEPA filters. In the North American definition, “true HEPA” means that a filter removes at least 99.97% of airborne particles of a 0.3-micron diameter in a single pass. For reference, human hair usually measures between 20 and 180 microns across. A particle with a 0.3-micron diameter is the toughest size to remove via physical, HEPA-type filtration. So both larger and—counterintuitively—smaller particles are captured more efficiently.
The European true HEPA equivalent—which is increasingly marketed in North America as “medical grade”—is designated H13, and its requirements are virtually identical: 99.95% single-pass capture of the most penetrating particle size (or MPPS). This is typically close to 0.3 micron.
We weigh the value a purifier offers. Without setting a strict price limit within each room-size category, we compare cost against specs (especially ACH), the estimated upkeep and electricity costs over the course of five years of operation, ratings from owners, and manufacturers’ histories of reliability and customer service.
And we appreciate smart control capability. Our years of testing have proved that a good air purifier creates and maintains excellent air quality when it is simply allowed to run continuously on a moderate setting. As a result, we do not insist that our picks have smart control options. But many members of our paid tester program have told us how helpful the ability to control appliances via an app or by voice command is for people with mobility or dexterity issues. Smart air purifiers also typically offer real-time and trend data on indoor air quality, and many allow you to set operation schedules, so that (for example) your purifier can automatically do a deep clean of your living space in the hour before you get home. In short, smart capability isn’t necessary to get clean air, but it can add meaningful utility to a purifier.
No thanks, ionizers and ozone. Many purifiers have an ionizer in addition to a HEPA filter, but most let you toggle the feature on or off, and we recommend the latter. One reason: The ionizers’ efficacy is unclear. The more important reason: Ionizers can produce a tiny amount of ozone as a by-product, and ozone is harmful to breathe (PDF). That said, among our picks with an ionizing option, none exceed the ozone production limit of 0.05 parts per million when in use, as set and certified by the strict California Air Resources Board.
A handful of air purifiers rely entirely on ozone to purify the air. We dismiss them categorically.
How we tested
The tools: Since 2016, we’ve conducted dozens of real-world purifier tests, measuring particle concentrations with a TSI AeroTrak 9306—a professional, high-precision particle counter commonly used to certify air quality to OSHA standards in factories and other workplaces.
The venues: We’ve tested air purifiers in homes and in apartments. Since 2020, we’ve been testing in a room at Wirecutter’s New York City headquarters. It’s a 135-square-foot office.
The tests: At the start of each test, we take a baseline reading of the ambient air quality for three minutes. We burn five wooden matches and let the smoke circulate for two minutes to raise the particulate levels in the air. We then run the purifiers for the remaining 30 minutes.
Smoke particles are right in the 0.3-micron size range—the hardest size to capture—that’s used as the HEPA test standard. If a purifier does well on smoke, it will do even better on larger particles like dust and pollen, and—somewhat paradoxically—on smaller particles like bacteria and viruses. For an explanation, see How HEPA filters work.
We place the purifiers at the midpoint of the test room (this is best practice in your room, too). The particle counter goes in the farthest corner of the room, ensuring an accurate reading of whole-room purification. The particle counter takes readings continuously, with counts totaled in one-minute increments.
We test each purifier at least twice. In a 35-minute test, we run the machine on its absolute highest setting. It’s usually noisy. In a separate test, we use the highest setting the machine can run while keeping the noise below 50 decibels; this is around the upper limit of what would be tolerable for normal conversation, watching TV, or sleeping.
We normalize the test data so that each machine’s peak reading of 0.3-micron particles represents the maximum particulate load it faced. We describe its overall performance as its maximum reduction of particulates relative to that load. We believe this approach gives the best apples-to-apples comparison because it eliminates inconsistencies in absolute particle concentration—which even in lab conditions is difficult to reproduce exactly from test to test—in favor of a common measure.
We test new and old machines. When retesting our existing air-purifier picks, we take four measurements—two using the old filters and two using new filters—to learn how (or even if) their performance changed over time.
We also make subjective evaluations. We have always judged purifiers not just by how well they perform but also by how easy it will be to live with them in your bedroom, living room, or office. For those factors, we measure how much noise the purifiers make when running, and we calculate their long-term costs for energy consumption and replacement filters. We consider the ease of operation and maintenance, the presence or absence of distracting lights (which can disrupt sleep), the simplicity of the controls, and their physical size and aesthetics.
And we simply live with them. We station our picks in multiple homes, often for years at a time, to judge how they perform in different environments, how durable they are against rowdy kids and other sources of damage, and whether positive attributes (or persistent annoyances) are revealed as time goes by.
Our pick: Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty
Top pick
Perfect for bedrooms, playrooms, and living rooms, this purifier is one of the highest-performing, most-durable, and most-economical models we’ve tested.
After over 20 rounds of testing, encompassing more than 50 different air purifiers, and after years of living with our various picks at home, the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty remains our pick as the best air purifier for most people. It has kept its place since 2015 for many reasons.
It’s a stellar performer. Across repeated testing and re-testing, the Coway Mighty has delivered some of the best performances of any purifier we’ve seen, and it has done so with amazing consistency. On its high setting, it averages more than 99% removal of smoke in 30 minutes. On medium, it averages 88%. And it maintains that performance for the entire lifespan of its HEPA filter, which should be replaced annually. We’ve always run our test units 24/7 for at least a year—in one case, for two years—and then retested them using the old filters and compared them with brand-new ones. In every case, there’s been virtually no drop-off in performance for this purifier. (Occasionally, we’ve even seen a tiny improvement: HEPA filters actually get more efficient at capturing particles as they clog up, at the expense of a small drop in airflow.)
It abides. Our first test unit ran for two years straight and was performing like new when it was discontinued for a newer version. The second one ran for four years straight, and it too was still working flawlessly when it was replaced (again due to design updates). That third model ran at our office for over two years straight while it was closed for the pandemic, during which time the office endured a small flood. The purifier was still working fine when we reopened.
It’s virtually set-and-forget. The Mighty requires very little setup and upkeep. Remove the plastic bag the filters come in, stick the filters back in the machine, and you’re ready to go. We recommend keeping the machine on the medium setting, which is quiet, energy-efficient, and effective: In past tests, we confirmed that in a room with windows and doors closed, this purifier will drop particulate levels to nearly zero within an hour and maintain that indefinitely.
It’s quiet. For a purifier of its capabilities, the Mighty is notably quiet. On medium (the speed we recommend you run it on), it measures just 39 decibels from a distance of 6 feet—a soft, fan-like whisper that’s easy to sleep or watch TV near. (Another argument for keeping it on medium is that its auto setting can rev up the fan to its highest—and much louder—speed without warning; this is true of all purifiers with an auto function.)
It goes dark. The Mighty has a feature that we’d like to see on all air purifiers: You can completely shut off its display while keeping it on the fan speed of your choosing. Purifier displays in general are overly bright, especially their air-quality indicator lamps, and if you’re sensitive to light when you’re trying to sleep, that’s a real aggravation. Many do now offer a sleep mode that (mostly) shuts off the display.
It stands up to punishment. Parents on our staff who own a Mighty report that it has stood up to toddlers banging on the control panel and older kids roughhousing with it. Senior editor Harry Sawyers said his boys discovered that it’s fun to throw balloons into the airflow (they can get stuck and hover midair) and to use it to inflate their T-shirts so they look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
It excels in air-quality emergencies, like wildfires. In 2017, we created wildfire conditions in our Los Angeles office and tested several purifiers. Using bunches of incense sticks, we created a thick haze of smoke in the room—which was four times larger than what the Coway is designed to be used in. It still dropped the pollution by 70% in under an hour, performing as well as some purifiers intended for extra-large spaces.
Operating costs are low. Running costs for the Mighty are easily the lowest we’ve found for a purifier of its abilities. Filter replacement is an annual task, whereas some competitors work on six- or eight-month cycles. And it’s energy-efficient: On the medium setting, it draws just 8.1 watts, so running it 24/7 on that setting consumes just 71 kilowatts annually. If you want to calculate that consumption as a dollar amount, the US Energy Information Administration lists up-to-date electricity rates by state.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
Some units had fan issues (but they seem to be resolved). In early fall 2020, a few reader comments and reviews showed up mentioning an imbalanced fan in the machine, which caused the whole unit to shake uncontrollably and, in some cases, led the fan to break. We asked Coway about this problem, and a spokesperson replied that Coway was aware of the issue and was working on strengthening the fans’ balancing mechanism. As of late 2022, the issue seems to be resolved, based on recent customer reviews.
Filter odors noted (also resolved). Around the same time, we saw complaints of a plasticky odor in new replacement filters. When asked for an explanation in February 2021, Coway representatives wrote: “The filter is manufactured by processing various polymer materials … and similar to new clothes, some initial odors may linger.” The reps added that the company “is currently considering adding an Air Blow process into production to minimize any potential smell and odors.”
Two Coway filters that we purchased in February 2021 had a slight odor, and filters that arrived new in 2022 had no noticeable odor at all. Most recent (2023) Amazon reviews that mention odor describe it as faint and dissipating within a day or two.
We tested two popular third-party replacement-filter sets for the Mighty, made by Cabiclean and Durabasics, and neither gave off any noticeable odor. They performed almost identically to the genuine Coway filter in our smoke tests, so we’re confident in recommending them. One caveat: Coway told us that “if a problem is identified using a third-party filter, the customer does not receive warranty service.”
The smart version technically works, but the app is lousy. We tested the smart version of the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty, the AP-1512HHS. The app is basic and buggy, but when it’s working, it does allow you to monitor and control your machine remotely. In evaluating the app, Thorin Klosowski, then Wirecutter’s editor of privacy and security coverage, found that it has terrible customer reviews, “and asked for several unnecessary permissions we weren’t comfortable granting, including access to location, the camera, and more.”
Runner-up: Coway Airmega 200M
Runner-up
Virtually identical to our top pick on features and performance, this purifier is a great choice if you prefer its looks or find it at a better price.
The Coway Airmega 200M is virtually identical to our top pick, the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty. The units are made by the same company, and they are physically so similar that their faceplates and filters are interchangeable. The 200M has a slightly more powerful motor, which may account for its marginally better performance in our tests: Running on its highest setting for half an hour, it reduced particulates by 99.4% on new filters (versus the Mighty’s 98.9%) and by 99.1% on old filters (versus the Mighty’s 98.9%). These differences are so small as to be functionally meaningless. So if you prefer the looks of the 200M, or you find it for a lower price, you can buy with confidence.
The 200M shares the Mighty’s display-shutoff feature, which we value highly because it turns off the overly bright air-quality indicator lamp and makes the 200M much more conducive to bedroom use. Visually, the 200M differs from the Mighty in that it has a square grille instead of a round aperture; like the Mighty, it’s available in both black and white versions.
Also great: Winix 5500-2
Also great
This purifier is terrific overall, but it has minor shortcomings, including a stark look, no display shutoff, and slightly elevated electrical use.
The venerable Winix 5500-2 performed just as well as the Coway Mighty in our testing. Both machines are similarly quiet, and the 5500-2 often sells for a bit less than the Mighty. It’s not our top pick for several reasons: It’s larger and (to most eyes) not as attractive; it lacks a display-shutoff feature, except when it’s on its lowest fan setting; and it draws more electricity, contributing to slightly higher running costs. But, simply put, the 5500-2 is an impressive purifier, and several Wirecutter staffers have happily owned this model for years.
In fact, all of the Winix purifiers we’ve tested have been impressive. If you can’t find the 5500-2, the Winix 5300-2 is identical in all important respects, though it lacks the remote control the 5500-2 comes with. The same goes for the Winix C535; this one is available only from Walmart and directly from Winix, but it often sells for less than the 5500-2 and comes with a two-year supply of filters. Finally, the AM80 and the Wi-Fi–enabled AM90 are standout performers, and they offer a sleeker, more-modern look.
Also great: Blueair Blue Pure 311i Max
Also great
With quiet operation, good color options, and performance matching our other picks, this is a great choice, although the cost of filter replacements can run relatively high.
The Blueair Blue Pure 311i Max is another stellar air purifier comparable in capabilities to our Coway picks. It’s extremely energy efficient, drawing just 30 watts on its highest setting (out of four), versus the Coway Mighty’s 68. And it’s a fantastic performer, reducing smoke levels by 99.9% on high and 99.7% on medium-high. It’s also notably quiet. It never breaks the 50-decibel limit we consider the maximum for sleeping, conversing, or watching TV near. And it emits 39 decibels or less—to the point of being almost inaudible—on medium, low, and the ultra-low “nighttime” setting.
Blueair explained in an interview that these attributes are the result of several engineering updates working in concert. The 311i Max’s motor and fan blade are more efficient than in earlier models, with a gently flared shape and a slightly larger surface area than in its predecessor (and former pick), the 311 Auto. In the 311i Max version, a redesigned outlet grille has more area for air to pass through. The filter itself uses the same technology as all Blueair purifiers, combining a non-HEPA (but very efficient) filter with a system that imparts an electrical charge to any particles that pass through, helping them stick to the filter the next time around, essentially via static cling.
Finally, the 311i Max has an updated livability feature that was long missing from the Blue Pure lineup: You can shut off the entire control panel display and the air-quality indicator, while still keeping the fan on the speed setting you want. And its child-lock feature, also new, is helpful in households with little ones.
The filters have a shorter replacement cycle than those of the Mighty and many of our other picks, at six to nine months, depending on usage (versus, typically, a year). The machine measures actual filter usage, not simply the elapsed time since the last filter was installed, so if you don’t run your machine all the time, you’ll get more life out of filters. In the long term, though, filter replacements will likely give the 311i Max slightly higher running costs.
Also great: Levoit Vital 200S
Also great
Similar in performance to other purifiers its size, the Levoit impressed in initial and long-term testing.
The Levoit Vital 200S is another excellent purifier and is similar to the Coway Mighty in both capability and livability. It excelled in our smoke tests, and it resembles the Mighty in energy usage and noise output (meaning it’s highly efficient and very quiet on its lower, everyday fan settings). There are four fan speeds to choose from (versus the Mighty’s three), so it offers a bit more flexibility. However, the medium-high setting approaches our 50-decibel limit on acceptable noise, so it’s not clear that this is a meaningful advantage.
Most important, the Vital 200S has a display shutoff that’s independent of the fan settings, so you can darken it at night while still keeping your air well cleaned. And our long-term test unit is performing without any issues, making us confident in its durability.
Upgrade pick: Blueair Blue Pure 211i Max
Upgrade pick
The Blue Pure 211i Max aced our tests, and on top of its powerful performance, it stands out for its energy efficiency, quiet operation, user-friendly features, and good looks.
If you need to purify the air in a space of 500 square feet or so, we recommend the Blueair Blue Pure 211i Max. It’s extremely powerful, and in fact capable of delivering our recommended four ACH (air changes per hour) in spaces as large as 750 square feet on its highest setting (though you probably wouldn’t want to run it that way all the time).
It’s also an exceptional performer, dropping the smoke levels in our test space by more than 99.9% on its high and medium-high settings. And it’s easy to live with: quiet, attractive, and energy efficient, with a full display shutoff as well as both manual and smart controls. The relatively high price is backed up by the performance, but this much purifier is overkill for medium-size and small rooms.
The 211i Max is a thrifty operator, drawing just 41 watts on its highest setting, and 18 and 11 respectively on the medium-high and medium-low settings where you’re more likely to run it during normal use. Like the smaller 311i Max, its engineering has been updated with a redesigned motor and fan blade. Relative to its predecessor (and former pick), the Blueair 211+, the 211i Max also has a more porous outlet grille and a slightly flared design with a larger, less dense filter.
The 211i Max’s filters have a shorter replacement cycle than many of our other picks, at six to nine months (versus a typical year). The replacement alert on the display reflects actual usage, though, not simply the elapsed time since the last replacement, so if your purification demands are low, you’ll wind up on the long end of that range.
One standout test finding was that the 211i Max is remarkably quiet, particularly for a machine of its capability. On the high setting, it barely broke our 50-decibel limit for comfortable conversation, sleep, or TV watching. On its four lower speeds, it measured a barely noticeable 41 decibels or less.
Both the built-in control screen and the app show the real-time levels of airborne particulates in three size classes (1, 2.5, and 10 microns, roughly corresponding to smoke, dust, and pollen). This is standard info in an air quality monitor, but it’s something we’ve rarely seen integrated into a purifier. The app also lets you remotely monitor and adjust the operating settings.
You can manually dim or completely shut off the entire display when you want a dark room. You can also shut off the air quality indicator. A child lock function keeps young ones from altering the settings (or that’s the intent, anyway).
Finally, because the 211i Max is likely to be used in a living room or other public space, it’s gratifying that Blueair put some real care into its appearance and upkeep. The tweed-like cover (which also acts as a prefilter) is washable and, when the time comes, replaceable. A pretty, silvery gray one comes standard with the machine, and three other soft, natural colors are available.
Consider whether you actually need a large-space purifier, though. Despite its impressive energy efficiency, the 211i Max still consumes more power on its everyday medium-high and medium-low settings than the top-pick Coway Mighty (and the Blue Pure 311i Max, an also-great pick) on equivalent settings. If you’d be using a Blue Pure 211+ to purify a space that these smaller machines could handle, that’s wasted electricity.
Budget pick: Blueair Blue Pure 511
For small spaces, like bedrooms, dorm rooms, and offices, the Blueair Blue Pure 511 is an inexpensive, easy-to-live-with, and effective purifier. Its small size and light weight mean it can sit on a desk or shelf (as well as on the floor), and its understated looks and automatic display-shutoff keep it from being a visual distraction.
In our tests, the 511 reduced smoke levels by 96.9% in 30 minutes on its highest speed, and by 89.6% on its medium speed. Even on its high setting it emitted just 48 decibels of fan-like white noise—quiet enough to sleep, work, or watch TV near. On its medium and low settings, it’s barely audible. A few moments after you change the fan speed, the entire display automatically goes dark, so it won’t bother you if you’re distracted by lights when trying to sleep.
Like all the purifiers in the Blue Pure lineup, the 511 is extremely energy efficient, using just 1.2, 3.5, and 13.6 watts on its low, medium, and high fan settings. The filter lasts about 6 months; a replacement cost about $20.
Weighing less than four pounds and standing just 13.5" high by 7.75" wide, the 511 can be easily moved around and fit into almost any space. For rooms under 180 square feet or so, it’s an excellent choice. But it is a very basic machine, with no smart functionality and no auto setting that self-adjusts the fan speed when the air quality changes. We’ll be evaluating the forthcoming 511i, which has those features, later in 2024.
A good purifier for VOCs
If you specifically need to address high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we recommend the Austin Air HealthMate HM400. Like our other picks, it uses a HEPA filter to capture particulate pollutants. But it also contains a massive, 15-pound adsorbent filter (composed of activated carbon and a class of mineral called zeolites) that efficiently captures gaseous pollutants such as formaldehyde. Unlike the tiny, short-lived VOC filters found in most purifiers, the HealthMate’s can remain effective for several years.
That said, in most parts of the country, simply opening your windows every few days is an effective way to flush out any VOCs. Weigh that free and easy option against the HealthMate HM400’s many shortcomings: high upfront and replacement-filter costs, energy inefficiency, physical bulk, and noisy operation.
Whole-home purification options—if you have central HVAC
If you already have central HVAC, you can use it to supplement portable purifiers with whole-house filtration.
An easy method is to install MERV 13 filters in the return registers, and we have a guide to them. (MERV is a 0-to-16 efficiency rating used for HVAC filters, and MERV 13 or higher is recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers for reducing airborne particulates like pollen, smoke, and PM2.5)
Here we’d draw your attention to a couple of other interesting options.
One is a sensor-equipped MERV 13 smart filter that can replace the generic central filter your system may already have (it’ll probably be installed at air handler). The other is a self-contained, independently powered filter unit that can add top-notch MERV 16 filtration to HVAC systems that were designed to use basic fiberglass or low-MERV pleated filters (and if your system is getting on in years, it likely was).
If you already have a MERV 13 or higher air handler filter in your HVAC system, along with a smart thermostat, one emerging option is the Woosh smart air filter system. This filter contains a Bluetooth-enabled pressure-differential sensor that monitors the filter’s usage and your HVAC system’s performance. Woosh founder Winston Mok explained in an interview how pairing the product with a smart air quality monitor or smart thermostat can change your understanding of your home’s air quality. (Woosh sells a monitor separately or bundled with a filter, or you can use your own).
The air quality monitor adjusts your air handler to continually address indoor air pollution. If the monitor detects an increase in particulate matter, it will tell the thermostat to ramp up the fan speed until the air is clear again. The monitor samples the air every 15 to 25 seconds, and in a demonstration, the air handler response was almost immediate (a single birthday candle set the monitor off). You can adjust the sensitivity of the monitor so that it will maintain the level of air quality and HVAC usage that you feel strikes the right balance.
The filters contain far more filter material than most. By using three pleats per inch (competitors typically use 1-2), Woosh filters pack more filtration into a given size of filter, which causes a lower pressure drop overall and less strain on the HVAC machinery. They’re rated MERV 13—the grade we recommend for HVAC systems for reduction of smoke, dust, and allergens.
Filter replacements are clever. Replacement filters consist only of the filter material itself, reducing waste. You install it in the permanent filter frame which contains the sensor and is expected to last five years. The sensor determines when the filter needs replacing by measuring how clogged the filter has become (versus a typical replacement schedule, which is chronological).
The filter can give early warnings of HVAC problems. This was an unexpected finding, Mok said. A Woosh customer had their AC compressor fail due to the condenser icing up; Woosh technicians later realized that they could have seen the impending failure in the sensor data if they’d known to look for it, so they added that monitoring ability to the software.
Woosh is not the only whole-house option we’re finding. If your HVAC system uses a coarse, net-like fiberglass or low-MERV pleated filter to protect the air handler, the Lennox PureAir whole-house air filter may be of interest. It’s a separate, self-powered fan-and-filter unit that can be added onto existing HVAC systems to improve air cleaning. The fact that it has its own fan means it puts minimal strain on the air handler—a concern for older systems that weren’t built with efficient filtration in mind. (The PureAir S, the smart version of the system, also syncs with smart assistants and smart thermostats to give you remote filter monitoring and control over your HVAC system.)
The PureAir’s MERV 16 filter is the highest efficiency below HEPA, and is exceptionally effective at capturing airborne particulates including dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, viruses, and smoke. A secondary activated-carbon filter reduces household odors and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like paint and adhesive fumes.
The PureAir also employs an ultraviolet (UV-C) sanitizing LED; this technology has been used for decades to deactivate airborne pathogens.
Asad Tahir, customer-centric product director at Lennox, noted that you will need sufficient room to install the PureAir equipment; its footprint is 16 x 25 x 5 inches. And you’ll need to get it professionally installed. After that, though, you can do the regular filter and UV replacements yourself.
How to set up, use, and maintain your air purifier
To get the most out of an air purifier, you need to set it up correctly, operate it properly, and perform very occasional maintenance. Here’s a list of what to do:
Remove the wrappers. Most air purifiers arrive with the filters installed—but they are also sealed in plastic wrappers. Open up your machine, unwrap the filters, and reinstall them. The HEPA filters should have an arrow or other marking to indicate the correct orientation.
Place them correctly. Install your purifier at least 18 inches from a wall and any furniture, ideally near the midpoint of the room you’re using it in.
One purifier per room is best. Purifiers work best in a contiguous space; if you want to clean the air in both the living room and a bedroom, for example, it’s best to get a purifier for each room or to move a single purifier around with you.
Oversized is okay. It’s better to have “too much purifier” than not enough. Manufacturers typically base their room-size recommendations (and CADR ratings) on tests with the machines set on high. But high is usually too loud when you’re watching TV or sleeping. Purifiers rated for larger spaces can operate on lower, quieter speeds.
Keep it running. Under typical conditions, we recommend running air purifiers 24/7 on their highest “quiet” setting—which we define as 50 decibels (dBA) or less. That generally means the medium setting on three-speed purifiers, or the high-medium setting on four-speed machines. Under known bad-air conditions, such as during a nearby wildfire, we recommend running purifiers on high for an hour every so often to deep-clean the air.
Close doors and windows. A draft or an open door can draw unfiltered air into a room faster than the purifier can deal with it. Normal in-and-out foot traffic isn’t an issue; just close the door behind you.
Clean the prefilter monthly. For optimal performance, vacuum, wipe down, or rinse off the prefilter (it looks like a window screen or plastic netting) every month or so. The prefilter catches larger particles, such as pet hair, and keeping it clean helps the HEPA filter work unimpeded on fine particles.
Schedule filter replacement. It’s easy to forget the occasional obligation of replacing your purifier’s filters—so set a calendar reminder. Purifier manufacturers typically recommend replacing them annually, but check the manual; some models call for less frequent or more frequent replacement.
Which settings should you run an air purifier on?
In conditions where air quality is poor, like when your area is affected by a nearby wildfire, we recommend running air purifiers on high for an hour and thereafter running them on the quiet or medium setting to create and maintain clean air in the home. After burning 15 wooden matches (to create an initial heavy load of fine smoke particulates), we tested this method with the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty and the Airmega 400 over the course of three hours—one hour on high, followed by two on medium.
Set on high, the AP-1512HH reduced the particulate concentration by 99.9% in the first hour. With the purifier set on medium over the next two hours, the particulate load remained stable, varying no more than 0.1%. In the first hour on high, the Airmega 400 also reduced the particulate concentration by 99.9%, and thereafter the particulate load varied by no more than 0.2% on medium. In these tests, the purifiers handled normal ambient air after we raised the smoke levels at the outset.
In a separate, similar test, we fed the purifiers continuously smoky air by burning incense sticks throughout the test. This test also included the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty, compared against a former large-space pick, the Blueair Blue Pure 211+. In that test, we learned we had to run the machines on high to maintain meaningful purification. Both models achieved this, cutting the particulates by half or more in 50 minutes.
How HEPA filters work
HEPA stands for “high-efficiency particulate air.” The filter technology is the result of an industrial need that became critical in the Atomic Age: high volumes of very clean air, vital for the production of microprocessors and other sensitive instruments. HEPA filtration is also fundamentally simple and cheap, which means it’s available to everyone today.
HEPA filtration is a physical process, but it’s not like what most people envision when they think of a filter: a net, or a colander, or maybe mosquito netting, where particles larger than the holes get caught and the rest passes through. Rather, in HEPA purifiers, a fan draws particles suspended in the air through a dense, felt-like filter that has billions of tiny gaps of varying size. Air passes through almost unimpeded—thus the “high-efficiency” in HEPA. But the maze-like web of fibers traps almost all of the particles, from relatively big material like pollen (10 microns or so) down to ultrafine, 0.01-micron (10 nanometers) stuff. That’s smaller than an individual virus.
Impaction: The largest of the particulates, about 0.5 micron and above, are captured via impaction: Unable to change their course due to momentum, the particulates simply slam into the fibers and stick to them.
Interception: Particles measuring less than 0.5 micron (but not too much less) are captured by interception: Their lower momentum allows them to flow around some fibers, but eventually they come close enough to touch one fiber on the way by, and again they stick.
Diffusion: Very fine particles measuring below 0.1 micron get bounced around randomly and are slowed by their interactions with atmospheric atoms and molecules. They eventually drift or get bounced into a filter fiber, whereupon (yet again) they stick in a process called diffusion.
Crucially, the hardest particles to capture are what you might call the Baby Bears: At 0.3 micron, they’re at the low limit of interception momentum and above the limit of diffusion—in other words, they’re “just right” to get through a HEPA filter. The solution is to make the filter dense enough that it has a sufficient amount of fibers to capture most of the 0.3-micron particles. According to the US HEPA standard, “most of them” means 99.97% of them in a single pass.
Molekule: Some of the worst air purifiers we’ve ever tested
In 2019, we purchased a Molekule Air—the company’s iconic original purifier—and found it to be the worst air purifier we’ve ever tested. Its performance on particulate pollution was dismal—and absolutely unacceptable for an $800 device. We later learned that many of the company’s advertising claims were found to be baseless, and Molekule subsequently retracted almost all of them. (You can read about the saga in our reports from February and June 2020; the Air was then known as the MH1.) That year we also tested a Molekule Air Mini and judged it to be similarly poor.
But both of those models have been retired, so in January 2023 we purchased and tested the company’s current models, the Molekule Air Pro and the Molekule Air Mini+. In addition to a HEPA filter, the Air Pro and the Mini+ employ the company’s patented PECO technology, which Molekule claims not only captures pollutants like smoke, bacteria, and viruses—as HEPA filters do—but also destroys them using a UV-based reaction.
Molekule Air Pro: Loud, expensive, but (technically) effective
The Air Pro is Molekule’s larger purifier. Molekule’s specs claim it is effective in spaces as large as 1,000 square feet. In our testing, it did do something the original Air didn’t: effectively remove fine particles from the atmosphere. On its highest setting, it dropped the smoke levels by 99.9% in 30 minutes—as good a performance as any purifier we’ve tested. Molekule does not share the actual numbers, but presuming the claimed “3x” airflow refers to the original Air’s 90 cubic feet per minute, the Air Pro’s maximum airflow rate would be about 270 cfm, slightly higher than that of the top-pick Coway AP-1512HH Mighty.
But there’s a deal-breaking caveat. On that setting, the Air Pro emitted an earsplitting 71 decibels, measured from a distance of 6 feet. That’s by far the loudest of any purifier we’ve tested, and it would be absolutely unlivable in real-world use. I could hear its jet-like whine from 40 feet away, and it was on the other side of a heavy, acoustically sealed door. For reference, we set the limit of comfort at 50 decibels, and humans perceive a 10-decibel increase as roughly a doubling of loudness. So the Air Pro is effectively four times noisier than what we consider to be acceptable.
At its highest sub-50-decibel setting (which was speed three out of six), the Air Pro performed similarly to our top-pick Coway on its medium setting, removing 86.1% of the smoke particles we’d filled our test space with in 30 minutes. But it was louder, at 43 decibels, versus the Coway’s 39.
The Air Pro is a power hog, drawing 27 watts on speed three—more than three times what the Coway draws on medium. On its highest setting, we measured it at 111 watts (the Coway draws 68 on high), and Molekule actually lists a bigger number on the Air Pro’s spec sheet: 123 watts.
The many critical reviews on Molekule’s Amazon store frequently mention noise, an unpleasant smell (we didn’t notice it), difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi and the app, and cost. It typically retails for $1,000, and replacement filters are $160. If you kept up with the recommended six-month filter replacements, you’d spend $1,440 over the course of five years. Add the cost of electricity and the purchase price, and you’d spend well over $2,500 on a machine that performs no better on particulate pollution than the far less expensive purifiers we recommend.
Molekule Air Mini+: Similar weaknesses in a smaller package
The Molekule Air Mini+ is designed for small spaces, like a bedroom or home office. In our testing, it performed far worse than our pick for those scenarios, the Blueair Blue Pure 511 which costs less than $100, versus the Air Mini+’s typical $350 or more. On its medium setting (speed three, out of five), the Air Mini+ reduced smoke levels by just 58.7%, versus the 511’s 89.6%. And even on its highest setting, at which it emitted an intolerable 66 decibels, the Air Mini+ reduced the smoke only by 91%; the 511 captured 96.9% on highwhile emitting just 48 decibels—quiet enough to watch TV by.
Along with its high up-front cost, the Air Mini+ is also expensive to maintain, requiring a $90 replacement filter every six months. It’s not particularly power-hungry, unlike the Air Pro. But on its medium setting, the Air Mini+ still draws more electricity than the far-more-capable Coway Mighty (our top pick among purifiers and a machine capable of keeping the air clean in a far larger space). As with its larger sibling, we do not recommend the Molekule Air Mini+.
What if you just put a furnace filter on a box fan?
It’s a popular claim: If you stick a furnace/HVAC filter on a standard box fan, you can make a useful DIY air purifier. To test this, we taped a 20-by-20-inch Honeywell FPR 9 filter to a 20-inch Lasko box fan, and we ran that combo through the standard 35-minute, five-match test in the 200-square-foot New York City space, with the fan on high. And you know what? It did okay, cutting the initial particulate load by 87% over 30 minutes on medium. That’s nothing like the 99% reductions our top picks achieved on their high settings, but the results were better than one might expect.
If you try this hack, carefully seal the filter around its entire perimeter with clear, pro-strength packing tape—any gap would have let unfiltered air pass through, the same as on dedicated air purifiers. Doing all this may damage the fan’s motor, and we wouldn’t consider it to be a long-term solution for air-quality issues. But if you experience an air-quality emergency—say, regional wildfires creating a purifier supply shortage—it’s worth a shot.
One other thing worth mentioning: A popular video of this hack, from the University of Michigan Health System, overstates its potential. The presenter places the particle counter directly in front of the filter—almost touching it with the sensor—and notes that virtually no particles are passing through. It’s more important to measure the effect of a filter on the overall particulate load in the room. We measure purifier performance at a distance from the machines, outside the path of the cleaned airflow.
The competition
In addition to the following models, we have reviewed and dismissed hundreds of purifiers since 2013 based on their specs, features (or lack thereof), livability, and price. Some well-known brands that have never made our cut include Alen, Bissell, IQAir, Rabbit Air, and TruSens, generally based on their elevated up-front and running costs relative to those of our picks.
We have also removed from this list many since-discontinued models we tested.
The Blueair Blue Pure 311 Auto and 211+ are former also-great and upgrade picks. They’re excellent, and if you own one of them, there’s no need to replace them. The 311i Max and 211i Max that now hold these spots are slightly higher performing and have improved energy efficiency and liveability features, but the older models are truly excellent in their own right.
The Blueair Blue Pure 411i Max, a small-space purifier, is physically similar to but less capable than the also-great 311i Max. Given the minor difference in price, we think the 311i Max is the better buy, since it will excel in both bedroom-size rooms and large living areas. The older Blue Air 411 machines (the 411, 411 Auto, and 411+) are former small-space picks, but they are more expensive than the similarly performing current pick, the Blue Pure 511. They’re incredibly energy efficient but not as capable as our current small-space pick, the Blueair Blue Pure 511.
The Clorox Medium Room is a former budget pick. It’s an excellent performer with features we like, including a display shutoff. But the Blueair Blue Pure 511 is smaller, quieter, less expensive, and just as effective.
The Oransi Airmend Small Room (and the similar medium- and large-room models) have a clever design, resembling a compact box fax. Oransi designed them to meet the need for a small, portable purifier in cramped spaces like urban apartments. The Small Room was an excellent performer in our testing, but we think all the Airmends have a dealbreaking limitation: Lacking built-in buttons, they can only be operated via a tiny remote control. Little bigger than a domino, it is easy for even a responsible adult to misplace, and it’s an irresistible curiosity for toddlers and pets.
We tested the Coway Airmega Icon purifier in April 2020. It’s an interesting machine, straddling the line between appliance and furniture, and it incorporates a second function: It has a built-in, 20-watt wireless device charger. Though it is an excellent performer, we’ve concluded that a standalone (and far less expensive) purifier and a separate wireless charger are more practical for most homes.
The Mila air purifier became a special-case pick in 2020, as a truly smart purifier that was also a great performer. But since then, decent smart functionality has become commonplace in the purifier category. And after our long-term tester’s Mila inexplicably died, we discovered that her experience was not unique; one Reddit user experienced six failures. Mila’s response—“There are ~300 customers like you around the world that had 3+ failures. We call you our triple crowners and we wear that badge with shame”—helped convince us to pull them as a pick.
The Levoit Core 300, a former budget pick, is far less energy efficient than the current pick, the Blueair BluePure 511.
The Oransi Mod+ is an impressive purifier meant for large spaces. It’s exceptional at capturing particles—on a par with our large-space pick, the Blue Pure 211i Max—and competitively priced, but it lacks some of the livability features we value. It’s louder than the 211i Max, consumes considerably more electricity, and lacks smart capability.
The Winix 9800 is a solid purifier meant for large spaces. Basically an oversize version of our also-great pick from Winix, the 5500-2, it’s a terrific performer but lacks an important usability feature: Its display only goes dark when it’s on its lowest fan setting, so if you don’t want to sleep in the glow of multiple bright LEDs, you have to give up any meaningful overnight air cleaning.
The T810 is yet another impressive purifier from Winix, closely resembling the Blueair Blue Pure 311i Max in its form, performance, and sleep-friendly display shutoff. It’s slightly louder, however, and considerably less energy efficient.
The Dreo Macro Max S is a high-performing purifier with a major flaw: an enormous, bright air-quality indicator lamp that shuts itself off only in night mode, in which the fan is locked on its lowest, least effective setting. The lamp can be shut off at other fan speeds via the app, but, as with virtually all smart purifier apps, this one has many reports of connectivity issues. A manual shutoff option would be an improvement.
Blueair says its DustMagnet machines “powerfully attract airborne dust particles like a magnet before they settle on floors and surfaces.” But those claims refer to a certain size range of particles, from 0.5 to 3.0 micron—smaller than the human eye can see—so you’d have no way of knowing. In our testing with a professional particle counter, the Blueair DustMagnet 5440i performed no better than the much less expensive Coway Mighty.
Levoit’s Core 600S is a powerful machine designed for use in spaces up to about 700 square feet, at four air changes per hour, and it performed very well in our tests. However, on its medium-high and high speeds, it produced a persistent rattle that we could not ignore nor fix by repositioning the machine and confirming that the filter was properly seated.
The Honeywell InSight HPA5300B, a large-space model, likely performs well, but after measuring its electricity demands, we dismissed it. It’s an absolute power hog, drawing 33, 60, 94, and 117 watts on its four (low to turbo) speeds, respectively.
Honeywell’s HPA300 performed well in our tests but was also extremely loud, topping out at 62 decibels on its highest setting and measuring 53 decibels on the higher of its two medium speeds. It’s large and visually intrusive, too: a black tower that’s almost 2 feet tall, 18 inches wide, and 10 inches deep.
The Coway Airmega 150 is the first small-space machine from that company. It’s sharp-looking, with a clean rectangular form and a muted, matte finish available in several colors. But at its typical price of $190, it’s too pricey for a machine made for spaces no larger than a bedroom.
The Coway Airmega 250 is the larger, more powerful sibling of the Coway Airmega 150. It’s equally attractive, but it’s only slightly more powerful than our top pick, the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty, yet it costs $200 more.
The Coway Airmega 240, a former pick for special cases, performs on a par with the top pick Coway Mighty and has a sleek design that our staff universally loved. But with more companies paying attention to their purifiers’ appearance, it’s no longer unique in combining form and function at a reasonable price.
The IKEA Förnuftig is neither a true-HEPA purifier nor an especially powerful purifier, period. It’s designed to capture PM2.5—particles 2.5 microns in diameter and above, in contrast with the 0.3-micron HEPA standard. That means it’s optimized for larger airborne particles, such as pollen and mold spores, rather than for very fine particulates, like wildfire smoke (as HEPA filters are). We tested the Förnuftig in a 200-square-foot room, focusing on how well it removed 3-micron particles from the air. It disappointed, removing just 85.2% of 3-micron particles in 30 minutes on high and 73.6% in 30 minutes on medium. Its performance on 0.3-micron particles was, as expected, worse: 64.5% removed on high and 53.5% on medium. Compared with other small-space purifiers we’ve tested in the same space, that’s very poor.
We tested the tower-style Coway AP-1216L in 2017. Despite its decent-to-solid performance, we don’t recommend it. The small footprint of 10 by 8 inches belies the fact that it’s 32 inches tall—the height of a kitchen counter—and so it takes up a huge amount of visual space. You’d never forget that you have a purifier in the room.
The AirSoap uses washable, electrically charged plates to capture airborne particulates. Our top pick Coway Mighty performed far better in our tests. AirSoap’s claim that it will save you “thousands” in the cost of replacement filters is ridiculous—you’d have to replace the filter on the Coway Mighty 20 times to reach even $1,000, which means you’d have to run it for two decades.
The Aeris Aair 3-in-1 Pro performs similarly on particulates to our pick for large spaces, the Blueair Blue Pure 211i Max, and it contains a large VOC filter composed of 2.2 pounds of activated carbon and alumina, which should make it far better at capturing VOCs. But it’s expensive, the filters last only six months, and replacements cost about $200.
AirDoctor sells an expensive purifier with a filter that it markets as “UltraHEPA,” claiming that the filter traps particles 100 times smaller than what HEPA filters can capture. It’s not true: All true-HEPA filters snag virtually 100% of the nanometer-scale particles that AirDoctor says is its unique ability to capture.
We’ve tested many Dyson purifiers over the years, most recently (2019) the Pure Cool TP04 and Pure Hot+Cool HP04. Neither model measured up well against our top pick, the Coway Mighty. We have also found no evidence that the fan function on Dyson purifiers makes them superior to other purifiers in the distribution of filtered air throughout a room. In fact, our years of testing have shown that any appropriately sized purifier will deliver filtered air rapidly into the farthest corner of a room.
The Medify MA-40 performs similarly to the top-pick Coway AP-1512HH Mighty, but it’s much louder, at 52 decibels (above our 50-decibel definition of “quiet”) on its medium setting and 42 on low. The Coway measured 39 decibels and 31 decibels (nearly inaudible), respectively.
The huge and exceptionally powerful Medify MA-112 is surprisingly easy on the ears, registering as “quiet” on its low, low-medium, and high-medium speeds (39, 42, and 47 decibels). But at 28 inches tall and 15 inches wide, it’s best suited to large commercial or public spaces—like casinos, which Medify says use the MA-112 to counter the effects of cigarette smoke.
The GermGuardian AC5900WCA was a star performer in our 2019 test, but we also found it to be much louder than the top-pick Coway Mighty, measuring 47 decibels versus 39, on its quiet/medium setting. And the quality of the sound was rough and whooshy, versus the Mighty’s steady white noise. It’s far more expensive to maintain, as well.
The Levoit LV-H133 is another competitor to the Coway Mighty. But it’s more expensive up-front as well as over the course of five years of upkeep. And its taller form and higher noise output make it visually and audibly intrusive.
The Levoit Vista 200 is a small-space machine, and it’s one of the best-selling purifiers on Amazon. However, it’s much weaker in its CADR specs than our small-space pick, the Blueair BluePure 511.
A budget pick contender, the Levoit LV-H132 performed poorly in our tests, reducing particulates in our 200-square-foot test room by just 60% on high.
Our previous top picks among large-space purifiers, the Coway Airmega 400 and Coway Airmega 300, are impressive performers. The same is true of the Coway Airmega 400S, a smart version of the 400. But the Blue Pure 211i Max, our equally capable current pick, comes out on top on price: It typically sells for several hundred dollars less.
Winix’s HR900 Ultimate Pet Air Purifier has lower specs than our less expensive top pick from Coway.
The Hathaspace Smart True HEPA Air Purifier has solid reviews and typically costs a bit less than the top-pick Coway Mighty. For that price, though, you get a machine that’s barely a third as capable: The Hathaspace purifier can produce, at most, two air changes per hour in a 350-square-foot room, whereas the Mighty purifier can deliver 5.7.
The GermGuardian AC4825 has been around for years and is, up front, cheap. But because of its higher energy consumption, it costs more to maintain than many more-capable purifiers, and it’s a tall, garish device that won’t blend into any decor outside of an Alien set.
In addition to the above models, we looked at and dismissed multiple purifiers from the growing crowd of knockoff brands. It’s plainly a Duff Dry situation, and there’s no reason to doubt that these suspiciously similar knockoffs would perform all that differently from the originals. But we place a premium on long-standing companies with a record of customer service—and these pop-up brands lack both attributes. Rather than address them individually, we turned them into a poem, since their names (and this isn’t an exhaustive list) are quite lyrical:
Sumgott, Koios, UNbeaten, Zibrone;
Afloia, Aviano, Mooka, Keenstone;
Partu, Geniani, KeenPure, Hauea;
Cisno, Druiap, iTvanila, Secura.

Meet your guide
Since I joined Wirecutter in 2015, indoor air and water quality have gone from being somewhat fringe concerns to central worries for many people. First wildfires, then the Flint and Newark lead crises, then COVID-19, and most recently PFAS drove the shift, and it has been a career-defining—and extremely satisfying—challenge to stay on top of the ever-multiplying products used to clean the air and water in homes and to counter the landslides of misinformation and fearmongering that can accompany them.
Since 2021 I’ve developed a third beat covering residential solar and other energy-saving technology and techniques. It’s great fun, not just because it’s an extremely complex topic, but also because the best approach for many people is also the simplest and cheapest: weatherizing their homes. Guiding readers toward solutions that don’t involve buying shiny new toys is the most edifying thing I get to do here.

The Best Cordless Stick Vacuum
Sabine Heinlein is a writer covering floor care. Keeping her multi-pet home clean is one of her more acceptable obsessions.
If you deal with frequent small messes, or if you hate lugging out your full-size, plug-in vacuum cleaner, a cordless stick vacuum could be your dream cleaning partner. But like a good marriage, using a cordless stick vacuum requires you to make some compromises. We’ve tested dozens of them, and the perfect model just doesn’t exist.
Depending on your priorities, we recommend the Dyson V12 Detect Slim and the Ryobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar. If you’re on a tight budget (and willing to overlook some red flags), consider the Kenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095.
Everything we recommend
Top pick
This nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and its dustbin is small.
Top pick
This sturdy, versatile vacuum has several useful attachments and a large dustbin. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile.
Budget pick
This model is cheap, lightweight, and agile, and it cleans a variety of floor types well. But its non-replaceable battery and one-year warranty are disappointing.
How we picked
- Hands-on testing
We’ve tested hundreds of vacuums over more than a decade, most recently evaluating 25 cordless stick models priced from $100 to $1,000.
- Cleaning ability
We measured how much baking soda, cereal, birdseed, glitter, and hair each vac pulled from four types of rugs and bare floors.
- Warranty and repairs
We looked for cordless stick vacuums with at least a two-year warranty, as well as a replaceable battery—a major plus.
- Convenience
We considered how easy and comfortable it was to maneuver each vacuum, and whether its attachments fit their purpose.
Top pick
This nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and its dustbin is small.
The Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes closer to an ideal stick vac than any model we’ve tested. It’s light and nimble around furniture and on stairs, and it even works on shelves, walls, and ceilings.
The V12 Detect Slim rivals more expensive vacuums (such as the Dyson V15) in suction, airflow, and cleaning power, and it comes with multiple brushes and attachments, including a motorized brush for pet hair. It runs for 45 minutes on a single charge, longer than most of the other vacuums we’ve tested.
It has high-tech features that make it almost fun to use, including a sensor that automatically adjusts suction, a laser headlight that illuminates dust in dim corners, and an LCD screen with a battery countdown and other information. It’s also one of the quietest models we’ve tested.
The biggest downside of the V12 Detect Slim is its tiny, 12-ounce dustbin, which requires frequent emptying. You also have to swap between two different brushes depending on whether you use it on carpet or bare floor.
It takes four hours to recharge—longer than most other models—and doesn’t stand up on its own. Dyson covers it with a two-year warranty.
Top pick
This sturdy, versatile vacuum has several useful attachments and a large dustbin. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile.
The Ryobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar is a well-rounded workhorse, though it’s heavy and harder to maneuver on stairs.
In our tests, it offered outstanding performance, picking up debris particles of different sizes and weights on all types of floors. Its large, 27-ounce dustbin, which is more than double the size of our other top pick’s bin, won’t quickly fill up with debris or fur.
Its motorized cleaner head works equally well on bare floors and carpet (you don’t have to swap brushes, as with the Dyson V12 Detect Slim), and it comes with a variety of useful attachments, including a motorized brush for pet hair and a surprisingly useful micro crevice tool for tight cracks.
The vacuum stands upright on its own and runs for about 35 minutes. The battery charges in two hours (one of the fastest charge times we saw in our tests) and is compatible with a variety of Ryobi tools. The Ryobi 18V One+ HP kit (which includes the battery and charger) is sold only through Home Depot and has gone out of stock at times, sometimes for several days or weeks.
This model has a three-year warranty—longer than the coverage on most other stick vacs we’ve tested.
Budget pick
This model is cheap, lightweight, and agile, and it cleans a variety of floor types well. But its non-replaceable battery and one-year warranty are disappointing.
Most cordless stick vacuums that cost less than $200 are terrible. The Kenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095 is a rare exception, but it still makes major trade-offs.
We found that it’s a superb cleaner on both rugs and bare floors, picking up fur and debris almost as effectively as our top picks.
This lightweight model cleverly folds in half for easier cleaning under furniture, and it has an extra-large, 33-ounce dustbin. It offers a solid 38-minute run time and recharges in four hours, similar to the Dyson V12 Detect Slim.
It lacks the convenient, versatile attachments that our top picks have for cleaning fur off upholstery, dusting shelves, or reaching into crannies.
But its biggest drawbacks are its weak one-year warranty and non-replaceable battery.

Why you should trust us
Staff writer Sabine Heinlein has been a journalist for over two decades. With a menagerie of rabbits and cats, she obsesses over how different types of fur adhere to upholstery and how to remove hairballs from heirloom rugs. Liam McCabe wrote the previous versions of this guide, testing more than a hundred vacuums for this and other vacuum guides.
For this guide:
- We’ve tested more than 100 models over the past decade (25 of them in 2023).
- We’ve interviewed experts, including present and former engineers at Dyson and Shark; product managers of major vacuum manufacturers; and vacuum collectors and repair specialists.
- We’ve read dozens of articles about vacuum history, design, and engineering.
- We’ve analyzed thousands of customer reviews on Amazon using the FindOurView artificial-intelligence-driven tool, pored over owner reviews on online forums, and talked to dozens of real-life cordless vacuum owners.
Who this is for
At their best, cordless stick vacuums are versatile, shape-shifting creatures that transform into different configurations with the help of useful attachments. They promise to clean everywhere, all at once, untethered by cords. Most cordless models are lithe and comfortable to use, even in cramped spaces or on stairs. Because cordless vacuums are compact and often packaged with either a wall-mountable charging dock or a floor stand, it’s common to store them within arm’s reach in plain sight.
But even the priciest cordless stick vacuum can’t match the suction and deep-cleaning power of a good upright or canister vacuum, especially if you have wall-to-wall carpeting, lots of rugs, or shedding pets. Their batteries typically last 30 to 40 minutes on a full charge, enough to clean a room or two but unlikely to tackle your whole home top to bottom. Cordless stick vacuums also have a shorter life expectancy than good plug-in vacuums. For most people, a cordless stick vac should be a sidekick to a plug-in vacuum.
How we picked and tested
In our most recent round of testing, we tried 25 cordless stick vacuums. Here’s how we evaluated them:
Suction and airflow
We first measured each vacuum’s airflow with an anemometer and evaluated its suction with a specialized suction gauge. You need high airflow because suction alone can’t move debris up the wand and into the bin, explained James Brown, service specialist and museum curator at Mr. Vacuum Cleaner. “If I put a penny on my hand, put the nozzle over the penny, switched the machine on, switched it off and let it wind down, the penny would still be there because there’s no air moving down the tube to take it to where it needs to go. But you can still feel the pressure of it pulling your hand to the nozzle.”
Cleaner head design
We paid special attention to each cleaner head, ruling out models without a motorized brush roll, because suction and airflow alone can’t remove dirt. “You need agitation, which is what the brushes do,” explained Brown. “They vibrate and sweep the carpet and dislodge the dirt. The airflow takes it away.” We also preferred models from which we could easily remove the brush roll for detangling and cleaning without special tools.
Cleaning performance
We then tried each vacuum on different types of rugs and on bare floors strewn with Cheerios, fur, baking soda, birdseed, and glitter. We looked for models that didn’t snowplow (when a vacuum’s low-riding cleaner head pushes around heavier debris instead of sucking it up), dump (when debris falls back out of a vacuum that’s turned off), or jam (when the motorized brush seizes on certain types of rugs and rug pads). We also checked each model’s anti-tangling technology by vacuuming up colorful hair extensions. We then ran the top performers in a multi-person, multi-pet, multi-rug home for several weeks to see how they handled a variety of surfaces and messes (cat and bunny litter included).
Comfort, convenience, and ease of use
We tested the comfort and maneuverability of each vacuum. To measure the performance of above-floor attachments, we tried them in a dirty car, a sewing room, and a laundry room, as well as on different types of upholstery. We also examined other sources of delight or dismay, including the dustbin emptying process, the vacuum’s ability to stand up on its own, and the presence of any extras such as a headlight or an LCD screen. We also measured each vacuum’s noise level with the SPLnFFT app.
Run time and charge time
Several company spokespeople told us that advertised run time is typically measured on a vacuum’s low power setting in handheld mode. That number rarely holds up in real life: Running a cordless stick vacuum’s motorized brush on bare floors and rugs draws more power and depletes its battery faster. We considered anything over 30 minutes an acceptable real-life run time.
We looked for batteries that charged within four hours or less, and we considered it a plus if a vacuum’s run time exceeded 30 minutes and its battery could also work in a variety of tools from the same company.
Reliability
In addition to suffering from battery failure on occasion, cordless stick vacs are prone to the same clogs, cracked plastic, and other mechanical failures as plug-in machines. We combed through owner reviews provided by an AI-assisted analysis service called FindOurView to pinpoint obvious design flaws or quality-control issues. We called customer service for each of our top performers to experience the process and to determine how easy it was to order new parts.
Warranty
We favored models with a warranty of more than two years. Damian Lee, a former engineer at Dyson and Shark, agreed that a long warranty is meaningful when you’re making a buying decision: “[It] gives you confidence that a company is standing behind their product.”
HEPA filtration
Most cordless stick vacuums have HEPA filters, but the existence of such a filter wasn’t a major factor in our decision-making. Even with a HEPA filter, a cordless stick vac is likely to expose you to dust and other allergens when you empty the bin. If you have serious allergies or asthma, you’re better off with a vacuum that collects debris in a self-sealing, disposable bag.
Top pick: Dyson V12 Detect Slim
Top pick
This nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and its dustbin is small.
Of all the models we’ve tested, the nimble and powerful Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes closest to being the ideal cordless stick vacuum.
It’s lithe and graceful. Weighing just over 5 pounds, the V12 Detect Slim maneuvers easily in awkward spaces and on stairs. Though most of its weight sits on top, we found the V12 Detect Slim comfortable for our hands and wrists. Its cleaner head swivels 180 degrees, allowing it to reach into tight corners, around table legs, and between furniture better than other vacuums we’ve tested. It’s also very quiet (73 dB) compared with other models. Whereas previous Dyson models featured an uncomfortable trigger-style switch that you needed to squeeze for operation, the V12 Detect Slim has an on/off button.
It sucks (in a good way). The V12 Detect Slim offers powerful suction and airflow, and it excels at picking up dust and debris on both bare floors and rugs. In our controlled rug-cleaning test, it devoured almost 100% of the baking soda we had spread out on medium-pile rugs—a clear sign that it is capable of targeting deeper-sitting dust and dander that other cordless sticks might miss. (One competitor picked up only a bit over 40%.) It also extracted fur from rugs well.
The V12 Detect Slim has three suction modes: eco (lower suction, which conserves battery), boost (stronger suction), and auto. The auto mode is particularly helpful, as the dust sensor detects dirt and triggers increased suction power when necessary; for example, in our tests the V12 Detect Slim regularly went into boost mode near a cat litter box.
It has two effective cleaner heads for different types of flooring. Designed to deep-clean rugs and carpet, the V12’s Motorbar cleaner head has tooth-like rubber vanes that, Dyson claims, automatically clear wrapped hair during cleaning. In our testing, the head readily captured 6-inch strands of hair, but the brush was less effective with 18-inch-long hair. (You can remove the brush, and you can cut off long locks with scissors or a box cutter.) On bare floors, the Motorbar head efficiently cleaned baking soda and seeds, but it tended to snowplow Cheerios.
The second cleaner head, the Laser Slim Fluffy, is made of soft microfiber fabric and is specifically designed to snag dust and fur from bare floors. It features a laser light that spookily illuminates dark corners—one moment the dust is spotlighted, the next it’s gone.
In our testing, we found that the Fluffy head picked up larger debris that the Motorbar head tended to snowplow. The Fluffy head swallowed everything we presented it with, aside from a large mound of Cheerios (which it choked on) and a huge cockroach (which got stuck in the brush housing).
It converts to a handheld vacuum with useful attachments. The V12 Detect Slim easily converts into a handheld vacuum and comes with helpful attachments for tasks around the home and in the car. Its mini motorized brush tool was one of the best we tested for removing pet hair from couches, cat beds, and car upholstery. Its combination tool allowed for quick switching between a wide nozzle and a brush; we found the brush particularly handy for dusting bookshelves and windowsills.
It has a decent warranty, and its battery and many of its parts are replaceable. Dyson’s two-year warranty on this model is decent, though that’s less coverage time than we’ve seen for many other high-performing cordless sticks. The V12 Detect Slim uses swappable, click-in batteries, and you can buy spare packs to extend the run time—though we’ve noticed that they are routinely out of stock on the website. (Often you can still get them by calling the company. Or you can find cheaper knockoff batteries, but we don’t recommend them.) The battery is one of the most common failure points on cordless stick vacuums, so Dyson’s swappable design means you won’t have to toss the whole vacuum if the battery goes bad. Many of its other parts, including its washable filter, are replaceable, as well.
It has cool features. The V12 Detect Slim’s LCD screen shows animated maintenance reminders, troubleshooting tips, and, most important, a battery-life countdown. Its chief gimmick is its particle counter, which estimates the number of differently sized particles collected and displays the tallies in a bar graph—supposedly to help you feel confident that you’ve deep-cleaned your flooring. We don’t know how accurate or useful the particle counter is, but it can be a fun motivator.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
- It’s expensive. Typically around $600, the V12 Detect Slim is pricey. During our testing, it gave no indication that it would be more durable than other, more affordable cordless vacs like our other top pick—let alone plug-in vacuums, which typically clean better, last longer, and, in some cases, cost less.
- It has a tiny dustbin. The V12 Detect Slim’s roughly 12-ounce dustbin is minuscule, capable of storing less than half as much debris as that of our other top pick. In our tests, we had to empty the dustbin at least three times when cleaning a 650-square-foot space with pets. The V12 Detect Slim ejects debris from the bin like a mini T-shirt cannon, an action that can easily lead to spills. We also found that debris often gets stuck in the dustbin’s upper segment, requiring you to reach in and pull it out.
- Switching between cleaner heads can be annoying. Though we appreciate the versatility and effectiveness of the Motorbar head (for carpet) and the Laser Slim Fluffy head (for bare flooring), switching them can be annoying, especially if you just want to give your half-carpeted dining room a quick once-over.
- It doesn’t stand on its own. The V12 Detect Slim’s inability to stand on its own is a source of irritation. You’ll need to find a secure spot to prop it up if you have to answer the doorbell.
Other high-end Dyson models worth considering
In general, Dyson is a reliable brand with a well-earned and particularly devoted following. If the Dyson V12 Detect Slim isn’t for you, the Dyson line includes other options (although they come with triggers).
We reviewed the Gen5detect and it is a great cleaner that is equipped with a couple of meaningful upgrades, like a suction bleed valve, a longer runtime, and a (relatively) large dustbin that is twice the size of the V12’s. But it is heavier than the V12 and feels less comfortable and less convenient to maneuver and store than its smaller cousin.
The V15 Detect’s dustbin is also twice the size of the V12 Detect Slim’s bin. Even though the V15 Detect’s motor has more muscle, it did not clean significantly better than the V12 Detect Slim in our tests.
The V8 Absolute is less powerful than the V12 Detect Slim and the V15 Detect, but it’s still a good value. Its bin capacity lies between that of the other two models, and it comes with many useful attachments.
The Outsize Plus has a wider brush and an even larger bin than the V15 Detect, but its motor is slightly less powerful.
Top pick: Ryobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar
Top pick
This sturdy, versatile vacuum has several useful attachments and a large dustbin. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile.
The Ryobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar isn’t as lightweight, nimble, or snazzy as the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, but it stands out in several ways—and it costs much less.
It’s an excellent cleaner. In suction and airflow, the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum performs almost as well as its most powerful competitors. We tried it on rugs, bare floors, car seats, and upholstery, and it did an excellent job of picking up all kinds of debris. In our baking-soda cleaning test, this Ryobi model extracted 96% of the debris—nearly as much as the Dyson V12 Detect Slim picked up.
The Ryobi 18V One+ HP vac has two cleaning modes, eco and boost. We found that eco worked fine for most surfaces and dirt—and it saved battery life—but we also appreciated boost mode when confronted with a dry, set-in hairball in a Tibetan rug.
Its all-in-one cleaner head is effective on a variety of surfaces. In contrast to our pick from Dyson, this Ryobi model has a headlight on its single cleaner head, with a plush roll in the front for bare floors and a stiff-bristled brush in the back for rugs. Unlike with the V12 Detect Slim, you don’t have to swap between cleaner heads to optimize this vacuum’s cleaning performance. In our tests, it was equally effective at picking up Cheerios on slippery tiles and pet fur on a medium-pile rug.
Despite the cleaner head’s size—about double that of the V12 Detect Slim’s Motorbar—it swivels smoothly around corners and furniture. With the help of a quarter, you can easily remove the brush rolls from the cleaner head to clear tangled hair.
It has an extra-large dustbin. The dustbin of the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum holds 27 ounces—more than twice the capacity of the bin in the V12 Detect Slim. Emptying the dustbin is easy, and you can clean and replace the filter.
It has an okay run time, and it charges especially quickly. This model runs for about 35 minutes in eco mode, enough time to vacuum a small or medium-size apartment and plenty of time for quick cleanups. Its battery recharges in under two hours—faster than that of any other vacuum we tested in our latest round. The battery has a helpful charge-level indicator light.
It stands on its own. The vacuum stands unsupported, so no need to scramble to find a place to prop it up if you get pulled away.
It morphs into a handheld vacuum and has useful attachments. The Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum easily transforms into a handheld vacuum, and its attachments are versatile and better designed than those of other models we’ve tested. In our experience, the crevice tool and pivoting brush worked great in a car’s tight storage compartments, and the motorized mini brush was one of the few tested tools that made a dent in the thick layer of fur on a car’s clingy trunk upholstery. This Ryobi vacuum also includes a micro crevice tool with thin, flexible straws that we found ideal for cleaning the interior of a dusty sewing machine and a dryer vent.
It has a generous warranty and replaceable parts. Ryobi’s three-year warranty on this model is longer than the coverage on most other stick vacuums, including Dyson’s. (Of all the cordless stick vacs we’ve tested, only the Shark models have longer warranties, but those are considerably more expensive.) This Ryobi stick vac is made from thick plastic and metal, and it feels sturdier in construction than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim.
Its battery and most of its parts and accessories are replaceable. The battery is compatible with many other cordless Ryobi tools.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
- It’s heavy, and it may be uncomfortable to use. The Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum isn’t quite as clumsy as it looks, but it is top-heavy: Its weighty battery sits behind the handle, with the motor directly below. This design can feel uncomfortable to use, and we found ourselves switching hands frequently while vacuuming.
- The plastic tab that allows the vacuum to stand upright broke. Twice during long-term testing, the plastic tab on the cleaner head that allows the vacuum to stand up on its own broke off. Both times, Ryobi sent us a replacement cleaner head. Ryobi told us that it has fixed the problem on current models. Customers with vacuums whose tabs broke while still under warranty (three years) should contact customer service to get it replaced at no cost.
- It’s had availability issues. Ryobi products are sold exclusively through Home Depot. The Ryobi 18V One+ HP kit (which includes the battery and charger) has gone out of stock at times, sometimes for several days or weeks. We haven’t seen stock issues with the vacuum-only model, so if you already own a compatible Ryobi battery and charger, it could be an option. (Buying the vacuum and charger and battery individually is much more expensive than buying them as a bundle.)
- Ordering replacement parts is inconvenient. Confusingly, Ryobi’s replacement-parts ordering portal isn’t linked on Ryobi’s homepage, and it took us multiple calls and an email to the marketing department to find the part we were looking for. The Ryobi ordering portal is also more difficult to navigate than Dyson’s parts website.
Budget price, great features, major caveats: Kenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095
Budget pick
This model is cheap, lightweight, and agile, and it cleans a variety of floor types well. But its non-replaceable battery and one-year warranty are disappointing.
We tested four cordless stick vacuums under $200, and all of them were terrible, with the exception of the Kenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095. It’s the only cheap cordless stick vacuum we’ve considered recommending—and we’re doing so with major caveats.
It’s a powerful cleaner, with an excellent brush roll. The DS4095’s ability to effectively pick up fur and debris doesn’t quite match that of the Dyson V12 Detect Slim. But a Wirecutter staffer who has been using it several times a week for the last six months to pick up fur and debris says it hasn’t lost any of its cleaning power.
It has a big dustbin. This model’s 33-ounce dustbin is much larger than those of our picks. In our tests, we were able to vacuum a fur-ridden 650-square-foot space without having to empty the dustbin once.
It’s cheap. The DS4095 typically costs nearly a quarter of the V12 Detect Slim.
It’s lightweight. Weighing less than 6 pounds—about as much as the Dyson V12 Detect Slim and considerably less than the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum—the DS4095 feels almost buoyant to use.
It’s foldable. The wand folds in half with the click of a button, a feat that proved helpful when we were rounding up dust bunnies from under the couch.
It has a decent run time. The DS4095 has a real-life run time of 38 minutes—shorter than that of the Dyson V12 Detect Slim (45 minutes), but a bit longer than that of the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vac (35 minutes). It recharges in four hours, which is standard. It’s also the quietest stick vac we tested (68 dB) in our latest round.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
- It has a weak warranty. The DS4095 comes with only a one-year warranty. A two-year warranty is standard for cordless stick vacs.
- Its battery is not replaceable. The DS4095’s single biggest flaw is that its battery can’t be replaced. If—or, realistically, when—the battery dies, the entire vacuum becomes useless. Chris Kobrick, director of Kenmore product management, told us that the battery will last roughly four years with normal use, but some Amazon reviewers have complained that their unit’s battery gave out after just three months. Once your vacuum is past the one-year warranty, it may be on borrowed time (though supervising editor Arthur Gies, who has been using the DS4095 for more than a year, reports that it’s working great). If you want a cordless vacuum that is more likely to last and less likely to end up in the landfill, choose either of our two top picks, both of which have replaceable batteries and other parts.
- It comes with just one attachment. Though the DS4095 easily converts to handheld mode, it comes with just one basic attachment, a tool designed for crevices and dust. In our tests, the attachment worked decently, but pet owners may miss having a motorized brush for getting fur off upholstery. (In comparison, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes with three attachments, and the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum has four.)
- It feels flimsy and doesn’t stand up on its own. The plastic housing and the flexible hose that connects the stick and the cleaner head feel cheap, and the DS4095 can’t stand unsupported.
Other cordless stick vacuums worth considering
If you’re a Miele devotee: You might like the Miele Triflex HX2 Cat & Dog. This model, which cleans about as well as our picks, is beautifully designed, nimble, and a pleasure to maneuver. It can work in three configurations: as a handheld vacuum cleaner, with the bin and motor (the heaviest part) below the handle, or with the bin and motor directly above the cleaner head. (We found the last configuration to be the best.) But it’s expensive, priced around $740 at this writing. Its cleaner head jammed easily on certain rug and rug pad combinations in our tests, and we found opening the dustbin to be a hassle. On top of all that, its 25-minute real-life run time and two-year warranty are disappointing.
If you frequently vacuum up long hair: Consider the Shark IZ862H Stratos Cordless Vacuum. It’s the only stick vacuum in our test group whose brush was able to handle 18-inch-long hair without requiring us to manually untangle it. This model is an excellent cleaner with an impressive five-year warranty. But we didn’t like the strong, artificial smell of its odor-neutralizing cartridge. The manual advises to avoid direct contact with the fragrance pod and to keep it away from children and pets, and Shark wouldn’t give us information about its ingredients.
The competition
We found the Dyson V15s Detect Submarine wet-and-dry vacuum cleaner to be heavy, awkward, and, at nearly $1,000, ridiculously pricey. Like the V15 Detect—its much lighter, vacuum-only cousin—this model has a trigger instead of a button. Its mopping performance pales in comparison to an old-fashioned mop; it’s also leaky, and its five separate parts need to be painstakingly disassembled to be cleaned.
The Tineco Pure One S11 was our previous top pick, and we still think it’s a decent stick vacuum. But our current picks are better cleaners. We also tested the new Tineco Pure One S15 Pet and the Tineco Pure One Air, its lighter, less powerful cousin, but both models allowed heavier debris to drop back out when we shut them off. Tineco’s product team told us that they were working to improve the issue.
The pricey Samsung Bespoke Jet comes with a freestanding (and bulky) charging and auto-emptying station. But when we tested this model, it wasn’t any better than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim or the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum.
Although the Hoover OnePwr Emerge Pet+ is similar in looks and performance to the Ryobi 18V One+ HP model, it costs more, has a smaller dustbin, and runs for a meager 25 minutes. We also tried the Hoover OnePwr Evolve Pet Elite, but we found it to be less versatile than the Emerge Pet+ because it lacked attachments for cleaning shelves, stairs, and ceilings. In addition, we were unable to disassemble the Evolve Pet Elite for storage after using it because its stick wouldn’t detach from its body. (We ran into a similar problem with the Bissell ICONpet Turbo Edge: After we emptied its bin, reinserting the bin was impossible.)
For its price, around $350 at the time of our testing, the Electrolux WellQ7 felt flimsy. It was a worse cleaner than our picks, too.
Several contenders—including the Greenworks 24V Cordless Green Stick Vacuum and the Fabuletta FSV001 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner—had cool LED displays or LCD screens but were incapable of sucking up and holding in debris effectively.
In our tests, the Dreametech T30 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner emitted a high-pitched whine and struggled to pick up medium and large debris. Its uncharacteristically long wand may make it awkward to use for shorter people.
The Black+Decker PowerSeries+ 16V Max Cordless Stick Vacuum snowplowed debris and dumped some back out once we switched it off.
The Shark Wandvac Self-Empty System comes bundled with an auto-emptying station, which in our testing failed to extract all of the debris from the vacuum’s teeny dustbin. Emptying the dustbin manually was awkward and easily led to spills.
What to look forward to
We plan to test several new cordless stick vacuums next: The Tineco Pure One Station Furfree Smart Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner is advertised as a hands-free self-cleaning unit that empties its dustbin and cleans its brush roll and filters automatically, and the LG CordZero All in One Cordless Stick Vacuum empties its dustbin into a bag at its docking station.
We are also curious how the Ryobi 18V ONE+ HP Advanced Stick Vacuum Kit and the Ryobi 18V ONE+ HP High-Capacity Stick Vacuum Kit compare to our current Ryobi pick. The former is advertised as Ryobi’s most powerful and quietest stick vac. The latter carries its weight on the bottom of the vacuum versus below the hand. Both models come with a generous 34-ounce dustbin, larger even than that of our pick.
Care and maintenance
Vacuum owners often think that their machine is broken when all it needs is a cleaning. Cordless stick vacuums are sold on the convenience of not needing bags, but they do require regular maintenance. “The number one problem is that people buy [cordless stick] vacuums, but they never clean the filter,” said vacuum repair specialist and collector Tom Gasko. Our full article on how to clean a vacuum cleaner has information for cleaning all types of vacuums, but here are six ways to keep your stick vacuum clean and maintained:
Wash or replace the filter. Check the manufacturer’s guide for specific instructions on cleaning the filter. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim, the Ryobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar, and the Kenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095 (PDF) all have washable filters. “Remember that the motor is trying to draw air to breathe through the filter,” said Gasko. “Clean the filters often, like at least every other use.”
Empty and clean the bin. An overstuffed bin inhibits airflow and suction. Hold the bin over a trash can and tap it until it’s empty. If the bin gets grimy, pop out the bin and clean the whole bowl (consult the manual first). Let it dry fully.
Check for clogs. Anything oversized or slightly sticky runs the risk of gumming up the works. Peer into the mechanism and pull out anything that’s stuck. If any part of the vacuum cleaner is clogged up, the machine loses suction power.
Clean the attachments. It’s important to clean out any fur, hair, or strings. (And in my house, hay.) Tangled-up brushes don’t just affect cleaning performance but also reduce battery life. “A brush clogged with hair means the motor is going to draw a lot more juice out of the battery and really reduce the amount of time that you can get out of the vacuum,” Gasko explained.
Don’t run your vacuum on high for more than a minute or two. Keep it on low or an “eco” setting as much as possible and save the high-power or “boost” mode for spot cleaning. Running your vacuum for long periods on the high setting can damage the battery, said James Brown, service specialist and museum curator at Mr. Vacuum Cleaner.
Maintain the battery and charger. Unplug your vacuum once it’s fully charged—or better yet, charge it only when you need it. Keeping the battery in the charging dock can shorten its lifespan, said Matthew Childe, director of energy storage at Dyson. Make sure that the charging contacts are clean and that the power adapter is in working order.

The Best Electric Toothbrush
By Nancy Redd
Nancy Redd is a writer who covers health and grooming. She has tested dozens of hair dryers, toothbrushes, and pairs of period underwear.
If you find an automated two-minute timer helpful or you need or prefer to brush with a powered assist, upgrading from a manual toothbrush to an electric toothbrush may be worthwhile.
After more than 120 total hours of researching the category, interviewing dental experts, considering nearly every model available, and testing 66 toothbrushes ourselves in hundreds of trials at the bathroom sink, we’ve found that the Oral-B Pro 1000 is the one to get.
Although it has few fancy features compared with the other rechargeable brushes we’ve tested, it offers the most important things that experts recommend—a built-in two-minute timer and access to one of the most extensive lines of replacement brush heads available—at an affordable price.
Everything we recommend
Top pick
This oscillating brush has an onboard two-minute timer, an audible pressure sensor, and a long-lasting battery. Its replacement brush heads are widely available and cost less than the competition.
Runner-up
This vibrating brush has the same key features as our top pick, and it’s less noisy. But its compatible brush heads are doubly expensive.
What to look for
- Powerful motor
A quality electric toothbrush does most of the “brushing” for you. Simply glide the oscillating or vibrating brush head gently across your teeth.
- Two-minute timer
An onboard automated timer helps you brush for a full two minutes, as dentists recommend.
- Affordable refills
We prefer toothbrushes that are compatible with a wide range of affordable, easy-to-find replacement brush heads.
- Substantive warranty
It’s reassuring to know that company support is available if an electric toothbrush fails.
Top pick
This oscillating brush has an onboard two-minute timer, an audible pressure sensor, and a long-lasting battery. Its replacement brush heads are widely available and cost less than the competition.
Our top pick for nearly a decade, the Oral-B Pro 1000 represents a superior value in a sea of electric toothbrushes stuffed with flashy features no one truly needs. It has a plenty-powerful motor, an automated two-minute timer that buzzes every 30 seconds to keep you moving the brush to all four quadrants of your mouth, and an audible pressure sensor that lets you know when to ease up. Plus, it’s compatible with eight different Oral-B replacement brush heads. In our tests, the Pro 1000’s battery lasted through at least a week of twice-daily brushing sessions before needing a recharge. The Pro 1000’s biggest drawbacks: It’s louder than other brushes we recommend, and it requires manual shutoff, even after two minutes have passed.
Approximate cost of ownership ($50 brush handle plus quarterly Oral-B replacement heads) after:
- One year: $66
- Three years: $98
Runner-up
This vibrating brush has the same key features as our top pick, and it’s less noisy. But its compatible brush heads are doubly expensive.
If you prefer a quieter brush with a head that vibrates instead of oscillates, the Philips Sonicare 4100 is the model we recommend. Its sonic vibrations are quieter than our top pick’s rotations, though they feel just as powerful. Like the Pro 1000, the 4100 has a two-minute timer with quadrant pacing, an audible pressure sensor, and a long-lasting battery. Unlike our top pick, this brush automatically powers down after two minutes of brushing. It's compatible with 10 different Sonicare brush heads (two additional options in comparison with Oral-B’s selection), but they cost more than twice as much as those that fit our top pick.
Approximate cost of ownership ($50 brush handle plus quarterly Philips Sonicare replacement heads) after:
- One year: $90
- Three years: $170
Why you should trust us
To find the best electric toothbrushes, we consulted oral-health experts including dentists, dental hygienists, and faculty at leading dental schools and research universities, as well as consumer advisers appointed by the American Dental Association, which confers a Seal of Acceptance on dental-care products made by companies that seek the certification, demonstrating the products’ safety and efficacy. We also consulted caregivers who help others with oral hygiene.
Altogether, over the past nine years, we’ve invested more than 120 hours in researching and evaluating electric toothbrushes, reading studies, and testing more than five dozen powered toothbrushes.
Nancy Redd is Wirecutter’s senior staff writer for health and grooming. Her family has personally tested more than 100 electric toothbrushes over the past five years, including dozens of electric toothbrushes for kids.
Who this is for
Per ADA recommendations, the only thing you need to brush your teeth effectively is a toothbrush—manual or electric—that you use properly along with the fluoride-containing toothpaste of your choice.
For over a decade, various studies have shown that powered toothbrushes remove more plaque and do more to reduce gingivitis than manual toothbrushes, as they help people brush for a full two minutes, improve uneven brushing across the mouth, and do most of the physical labor.
If you already have an electric toothbrush you’re happy with, no need to consider upgrading. If you use a manual brush and don’t struggle to maintain good brushing habits, you also have little reason to consider upgrading.
Electric toothbrushes are more expensive than manual ones, and not just at the outset. Powered brushes typically cost upwards of 10 times as much as manual toothbrushes, and you have to replace the brush heads at the same frequency, every three months, each for about the same cost as a manual brush. What you get for the higher cost is less friction in achieving good brushing habits.
On average, without a countdown clock, “folks brush 46 seconds,” said Joan Gluch, PhD, RDH, PHDHP, the division chief of community oral health at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Dental Medicine. “With timers, people will go for at least the two minutes. Clinically, we see patients do better with powered toothbrushes.”
Mark Wolff, DDS, PhD, dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Dental Medicine, agreed. Powered toothbrushing “helps people that don’t brush well,” he said. “If you need the guidance, invest in the guidance.”
How we picked and tested
Over nearly a decade, we’ve tested (and in many cases retested) more than five dozen different electric toothbrushes. We’ve assessed what it’s like to use each brush twice daily over several months and—for our picks—years.
That process has involved timing brushing sessions and battery life, replacing brush heads every three months or more frequently as needed, and cleaning handles and charging stands. To stress-test the toothbrushes, we fully submerge in water every model we consider, and we drop them onto tiled floors from a height of around 6 feet. To assess the approximate noise that each brush produces when powered on, we use the NIOSH Sound Level Meter app.
After talking with experts, sorting through the dental-care research, and, most important, using myriad electric toothbrushes with all sorts of features and claimed capabilities, we’ve learned that all you really need from an electric toothbrush is a powerful motor and a two-minute timer to make sure you brush your teeth for the right amount of time.
Nice-to-haves include quadrant pacing (when a brush either produces an additional buzz or stops buzzing every 30 seconds, letting you know it’s time to move on to brush another quarter of your teeth) and a pressure sensor (when a brush either produces an additional buzz, stops buzzing, or flashes a light to tell you that you’re applying too much pressure when brushing).
There are no independent studies comparing the performance of sonic or vibrating toothbrushes with oscillating models; most studies that do exist are industry-funded and include the brands’ own products. Experts told us that the choice mostly boils down to personal preference. Our testers found this to be true within their own households, as partners or kids often strongly preferred an oscillating brush over a vibrating one or vice versa.
In deciding which rechargeable electric toothbrushes to recommend, we prioritized two features:
- Automated two-minute timer: Just about all electric toothbrushes have this feature. The best models have a two-minute timer with quadrant pacing that aids you in spending an even 30 seconds brushing the teeth in each quadrant of your mouth.
- Affordable, widely available replacement heads: Brush-head preferences are personal. “Everyone reacts differently” to brush head shapes and sizes, said Bruce Schechner, DDS, a New York–based general and cosmetic dentist. Whether a brush head includes elements such as rubber-like flaps between the nylon bristles doesn’t matter for oral health, he added, but bristles should be “soft to medium, at hardest.”
We also considered the following:
- Pressure sensors: Some people have the tendency to brush too hard, which can cause gum damage, among other issues. A brush that buzzes, beeps, or lights up can let you know when to let up while you’re brushing. Some people find such a feature especially useful. Others don’t.
- Warranty coverage: Ideally, an electric toothbrush should be covered by a warranty for at least a year.
As part of the American Dental Association’s Seal of Acceptance program, the makers of oral-care products, such as electric toothbrushes and water flossers, can choose to submit data for an ADA-associated panel to review according to a set of criteria. Not all companies seek this certification for their products. Because the only factors that the ADA has found critical to maintaining oral health are brushing for two minutes with a reasonably soft brush and using proper technique, we consider an ADA Seal of Acceptance nice but not necessary.
For this guide, we focus on electric toothbrushes with rechargeable batteries. Those with replaceable batteries tend to have less-powerful motors and produce more battery waste over their usable lives.
Our pick: Oral-B Pro 1000
Top pick
This oscillating brush has an onboard two-minute timer, an audible pressure sensor, and a long-lasting battery. Its replacement brush heads are widely available and cost less than the competition.
The Oral-B Pro 1000 comes with all the features experts recommend, for a reasonable price. It has a two-minute timer with quadrant alerts at 30-second intervals, and it’s compatible with a wide selection of relatively affordable brush heads. We’ve recommended this brush since 2015, and it continues to perform well in long-term testing.
Its motor is plenty powerful. Oral-B powered toothbrushes have brush heads that rotate and pulse—at a rate, the company claims, of up to 48,800 movements per minute. As a quality electric toothbrush should, the Pro 1000 does most of the “brushing” for you. Despite its high-power motor, the brush handle doesn't vibrate along with the brush head, so you feel the buzz at your teeth, not in your hand.
It’s easy to operate. The Pro 1000 has a simple one-button interface, which you use to turn the brush on and off as well as to cycle through its three cleaning modes, “daily clean,” “sensitive,” and “whitening.” To charge it, simply place the brush handle on its stand.
Quadrant pacing brings order to brushing chaos. This brush’s pacing timer goes off every 30 seconds, alerting you to move the brush to another quadrant of your mouth. After two minutes, the brush pulses three times to signal that a full cycle is up. It remains powered on in case you want to keep brushing; you must always manually turn it off.
It’s reliable and durable. The Pro 1000’s battery is rated to last for seven days of brushing sessions on one charge; in our testing, it lasted for over 10 days on average. This brush has also survived several floor-drop and water-dunk tests—and, in the case of a test unit we bought in 2017, seven years of twice-daily use. Oral-B covers the Pro 1000 with a limited two-year warranty, and all Oral-B brush purchases come with a 60-day money-back guarantee.
You have lots of brush-head options to choose from. At around $5 each when bought in bulk, Oral-B replacement brush heads cost less than those from Philips Sonicare and many other competitors. Dentists recommend getting a new toothbrush every three months, so these cost savings can add up over time. You can choose from eight varieties to find the one you like best.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
Oral-B brushes like the Pro 1000 are louder, and more sonically grating, than comparable Philips Sonicare models. Without a point of comparison, you may not detect this difference in the sound. It’s also something our testers quickly got used to. Our sound-meter test registered 35 decibels in the toothbrush’s standard, “daily clean” mode.
The battery-life indicator is vague. It only lets you know when the battery is full (a continuous green light for five seconds after you remove the brush from the charging base) and when it is “low” (a red flashing light after you turn the brush off). Oral-B does not specify how long it takes to get the Pro 1000 to a full charge, but according to the company, you can charge the brush every day without significantly affecting the battery’s capacity as long as you fully deplete it once every six months.
The pressure sensor isn’t especially effective. Although this sensor stops the brush’s rotation when you bear down too hard, our testers have needed to press harder than expected to activate it. We’ve found the light-up pressure sensor on the Oral-B iO Series 6 brush to be much more effective.
The Pro 1000 does not come with a storage case or brush-head caps. But you can find plenty of options for covering the brush head for travel or whenever you aren’t using the brush.
Runner-up: Philips Sonicare 4100
Runner-up
This vibrating brush has the same key features as our top pick, and it’s less noisy. But its compatible brush heads are doubly expensive.
The Philips Sonicare 4100 produces powerful vibrations and runs quieter than our top pick—around 30 decibels at the higher-intensity setting, per our sound-meter testing. It also has the same key features, namely a two-minute timer with quadrant pacing and compatibility with a variety of brush heads, though they cost a bit more than those that work with the Oral-B Pro 1000.
Unlike the Pro 1000, which has three cleaning modes with varying intensities, the 4100 gives you just two vibration intensities, strong or stronger. Our testers have found that the higher-intensity setting on the 4100 roughly matches the feel of the Pro 1000’s “daily clean” mode.
It has great battery life. The 4100’s battery lasts longer on a full charge than the Pro 1000’s. Philips officially rates it to last two weeks on a single charge, versus one week for our Oral-B top pick. In our testing, the 4100 lasted for an average of 16 days of twice-daily use.
It’s as easy to operate as our top pick. With the brush’s one-button operation, you tap once to power it on and double-tap to up the intensity. The 4100 automatically powers down at the end of a two-minute brushing cycle, or you can switch it off sooner than that with a single button push.
The brush heads are narrower than our top pick’s. The brush heads that fit the 4100 likely make this model a better choice for people with smaller mouths. (For an even smaller brush head, consider one of our electric toothbrush for kids recommendations, the smaller but plenty powerful Philips Sonicare for Kids.)
The brush heads each come with a cover. Unlike Oral-B replacement brush heads, Philips Sonicare refills come with brush caps—tiny plastic hoods you can pop off and on to help guard against the coliform sprays flying around the bathroom. These caps are a touch too loose to stay put if you toss the brush in a bag for travel, however. And some people may find these bits of extra plastic undesirable.
This brush is backed by a strong warranty. Like our top pick, the 4100 has a limited two-year warranty (PDF). All Philips Sonicare toothbrushes come with a 90-day money-back guarantee (30 additional days beyond Oral-B’s policy).
Flaws but not dealbreakers
Its vibrations can feel uncomfortable. Even on its lower intensity setting, the 4100’s vibrations can be felt throughout the entire brush during use. This sensation can be especially irritating when the back of the brush head—made entirely of rigid plastic—knocks against opposing teeth.
Its replacement brush heads are generally more expensive. Philips Sonicare replacement brush heads can cost more than double the price of Oral-B’s, making ownership of the 4100 costlier over the long run. Most of the 10 options in Philips Sonicare’s brush-head line are oblong with soft bristles. The line lacks options with additional structural elements, such as rubber flaps or “polishing cups,” which are available from Oral-B and other competitors.
Its charger lacks a standard two-prong plug. Since October 2021, the charging pedestal that accompanies any new 4100 (or 1100, 2100, or 3100) brush from Philips Sonicare has had only a USB plug, not a standard, two-prong plug. A spokesperson for Philips Sonicare said that this change stemmed from the company’s effort to reduce waste and the amount of plastic used in its products. Customers who need a wall adapter can contact customer service to request one for free.
Other good electric toothbrushes
If you want an oscillating electric toothbrush that's less expensive than the Oral-B Pro 1000: The Oral-B Pro 500 is the model to get. It represents a slight downgrade in comparison with our top pick, but it’s a worthwhile upgrade over Oral-B’s lowest-priced rechargeable brush, the Vitality. And the Pro 500 is far and away better than other lower-cost oscillating brushes we’ve considered. Choosing the Pro 500 over the Pro 1000 means sacrificing a pressure sensor and a small amount of stated battery capacity in exchange for a grippier handle. In our experience, the brushing experience has been very similar to that of the Pro 1000. Like our top pick, the Pro 500 has a two-minute timer with quadrant pacing. It offers two modes (one fewer than our top pick) and is compatible with all standard Oral-B replacement brush heads and covered by a two-year warranty.
If you want a vibrating electric toothbrush that’s less expensive than the Philips Sonicare 4100: We recommend the Philips Sonicare 1100. Like our runner-up, it has a two-week battery life on a full charge and a two-minute timer that buzzes at 30-second intervals. The 1100 lacks the pressure sensor and the brush-head replacement reminder light that the 4100 has, though. And it has only one intensity, which feels like the lower intensity setting on the 4100. Like the 4100, the 1100 is compatible with all Philips Sonicare replacement brush heads. It is also warrantied for two years.
If you really want to upgrade from the Oral-B Pro 1000: Consider the Oral-B iO Series 6. This brush’s standout features serve to make brushing interactive—fun, even—without requiring you to pair the brush with the Oral-B app (which we found marginally useful). It has a lighted pressure sensor, plus a digital timer and battery-indicator display, visual aids that for some people may justify the extra investment. We found that the iO Series 6 ran more quietly than the Pro 1000 across each of its five settings, about as loud as the Philips Sonicare 4100 on its highest setting; our sound-meter testing put the iO Series 6’s “daily clean” mode, for example, at 31 decibels. However, the iO Series 6 regularly costs three times as much as the Pro 1000, and its replacement brush heads cost more than double. (Standard Oral-B replacement heads are not compatible with iO Series models.) The size and shape of the iO Series brush heads led some testers to have a more drooly experience in comparison with brushing with the Pro 1000. Some owner reviews also note the need to clean the junction between the brush head and the handle daily. Like the Pro 1000, the iO Series 6 is covered by a two-year warranty.
What about smart toothbrushes?
It’s been a decade since the first app-connected, or “smart,” electric toothbrushes became available, but most such models are still at least double the price of a standard electric toothbrush. As we’ve found over the years, the “smarter” the toothbrush, the more disappointing the experience, because the brushes’ apps tend to be buggy.
Smart-toothbrush capabilities vary widely, but mainly these devices automate the process of tracking your brushing habits, typically by connecting to an app via Bluetooth. Some smart models, such as the Quip Smart and models in Oral-B’s iO Series, attempt to track where the brush head is in your mouth, with varying specificity and results.
After years of testing, we’d recommend smart toothbrushes only for people who can benefit from added guidance and feedback through the brushing process and may find a smart toothbrush a useful tool for maintaining oral health. For example, people with physical or neurological issues that can complicate oral hygiene might find smart toothbrushes’ habit-tracking and coaching support priceless. “If you brush really well with an [unconnected] toothbrush, you don’t need any of these devices,” said Mark Wolff, DDS, PhD, who has provided dental care for people with various disabilities for more than 40 years. However, he added, “the feedback offered by connected toothbrushes is a game-changer” for some people or their caregivers, especially in cases where, for whatever reason, a person has difficulty brushing all of their teeth well enough, for long enough, and often enough.
People with ADHD, for example, might benefit from a digital display or an app focusing their attention on the task at hand for the amount of time it takes to properly brush each quadrant of the mouth. People with Parkinson’s disease or other conditions that may cause dexterity issues may appreciate toothbrushes that can adjust the intensity of the vibrations and possibly track missed areas. Some people with autism may benefit from the gamification that some smart toothbrushes’ apps provide. “I have a nonverbal 14-year-old autistic son who loves his connected toothbrush because the app makes brushing enticing and visually stimulating,” said Barbara Vartanian, the director of oral health advocacy and policy initiatives at New York University’s College of Dentistry. “It gives push reminders and has a timer, and also the app puts a funny hat on his face and prompts him to attack the bugs, which he loves.”
Caregivers of people who are unable to brush their own teeth can find support with connected toothbrushes as well. “It is very difficult to clean someone else’s teeth,” said Ann Spolarich, professor and assistant dean at A.T. Still University’s Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health. When it comes to smart toothbrushes that purport to track the brush head’s location, “the beauty of an app connected to a toothbrush is that you can use it as a guide to make sure you’re reaching all the areas of the mouth.”
Nearly all electric toothbrushes that pair to apps collect varying amounts of personal information. In most cases, the only way to opt out of having your data—anonymized or not—disclosed to affiliates and third parties for a variety of purposes is to avoid downloading and using the app entirely.
You can find plenty of free apps—including Oral-B’s app for Android and iOS—that you can use with non-smart brushes, powered or manual, to time and track your toothbrushing, remind you to clean your tongue and to floss, and so on. María López Howell, DDS, of the Garden Ridge Center for Dentistry in Texas, pointed to the Children’s Oral Health campaign’s 2min2x website, produced in collaboration with the Ad Council, which offers a series of two-minute videos that kids (or adults) can watch while brushing.
“You don’t need all of these more costly brushes,” López Howell said. No matter the toothbrush, manual or powered, smart or not, “brush twice a day for two minutes with a fluoride toothpaste, floss once daily, and visit your dentist to make sure that you’re doing the right thing.”
The competition
Oscillating toothbrushes
The Oral-B Vitality ($20) is the brand’s least-expensive electric toothbrush with a rechargeable battery. Oral-B declined to disclose the number of oscillations, vibrations, brushstrokes, or bristle movements for any of its toothbrushes, but we noticed that the Oral-B Vitality’s movements felt weaker than those of the Oral-B Pro 1000 and Pro 500 ($40). It is equipped with one mode and buzzes after two minutes of brushing but does not offer quadrant pacing. It has the same grippy body as the Pro 500, and like that model and our top pick, it’s compatible with standard Oral-B replacement brush heads and warrantied for two years.
Brushes in the Oral-B iO Series start at about $60 for the iO Series 2 and go up to about $400 for the iO Series 10. The iO Series 6, which has a lighted pressure sensor and a digital display with a countdown clock, currently represents the best value in the line. Unlike other electric toothbrushes in Oral-B’s line, the iO Series models are compatible only with iO-specific replacement brush heads; the most economical offer at this writing is about $8 each in a package of four, but they can cost as much as $15 each. Each iO Series brush has an onboard two-minute timer with quadrant pacing and a varying number of cleaning modes. All iO Series models can connect to the Oral-B app, which tracks your brushing duration; depending on the iO Series model, the app may also track where you’re brushing on an interactive color display of the mouth. The idea behind this feature—and the brush-head position detection on several other smart toothbrushes—is to provide you with an overview of which teeth you’re cleaning well and which teeth you may want to pay more attention to. Brushing with an iO Series brush feels high tech, and the position detection was accurate in our limited test runs.
An Oral-B representative informed us that the company’s Smart and Genius series brushes will eventually be phased out in favor of iO Series models. Brushes in the Oral-B Smart series include the Smart 1500, which does not connect to an app but offers a lighted pressure sensor. The Smart 5000 connects to Oral-B’s app to track how often and how long you brush, as well as whether you tend to press too hard. Oral-B’s Genius series includes the Genius 7000, which has six cleaning modes programmed to a separate power button. The Genius 8000 can track the brush’s position in your mouth, thanks to onboard location sensors and access to your phone’s front-facing camera. The Genius X, like the Genius 8000, can connect to your phone. Rather than using your phone’s front-facing camera, however, the Genius X uses onboard sensors and “artificial intelligence” to track the brush head’s location as you move it around your mouth. We found the tracking spotty, as the app counted some unbrushed teeth as clean.
Few competitors regularly cost less than the Oral-B Vitality. Among them are the Amazon Basics Rechargeable Toothbrush and the Bitvae R2. The Amazon Basics brush represents a minimal cost savings over time, and its replacement brush heads are harder to find than Oral-B’s. The Bitvae brush, on the other hand, is especially competitive on price—the brush, plus a two-year supply of replacement brush heads, generally costs around $25—and has a visible pressure sensor. In our testing we found that the R2, which also has a two-minute timer with quadrant pacing, emitted an irritating, extremely loud noise while in operation, making it hardly usable.
The Quip 360, the brand’s first rechargeable oscillating toothbrush, typically costs $55 if you forgo the optional subscription refill plan (replacement heads cost $12 each, plus shipping, when purchased outside of a subscription). The brush has quadrant pacing and automatically powers down after running for two minutes. It has three intensity options you cycle through with a single button. Unlike our picks, it has a visible pressure sensor. We found the pressure sensor effective, but somewhat hard to see when brushing bottom teeth (the light shines on only one side of the brush handle). When you bite down on the brush head, the 360 temporarily powers down until you let up on the pressure. In our testing, the 360’s battery lasted 32 days of twice-daily brushing on a single charge—two days longer than advertised. It runs at about 40 decibels, making it louder than our picks, but not terribly so. The handle’s rounded bottom is a flaw (possibly, a dealbreaker). There’s no way to set the brush down on its own without it toppling over or rolling. You can either drop the brush into its USB charging stand or purchase a magnetic mirror mount separately ($15).
Vibrating toothbrushes
The Philips Sonicare 2100 ($35), 3100, 5100, 5300, 6100, 6500, and 7500 ($200) all feature the same technology as the 4100 and 1100 models we recommend, with a manufacturer-stated 31,000 bristle movements per minute. They differ in available levels of intensity (for instance, the 2100 offers two levels while the 6100 offers three) and the number of cleaning modes (the 1100 and 2100 have only one, while the 6100 has three). The pricier models in this line come with a travel case and other accessories.
Philips Sonicare DiamondClean series brushes have sensors designed to offer brush-head position detection when the brush is synced to the Philips Sonicare app. The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart 9300 has a lighted pressure sensor and a lovely charging cup. In our experience, it has provided nearly the same experience as brushing with the top-of-the-line Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige—a $400 brush.
Philips Sonicare ExpertClean series brushes pair with the app to collect brushing data in a more perfunctory way, logging each time you brush and for how long, as well as how much pressure you use while brushing. We tested the Philips Sonicare ExpertClean 7500, which is around the same price as the DiamondClean Smart 9300 but performed worse in our tests.
The Philips One by Sonicare is a beautiful, slim toothbrush with a rubber-like material on the back of the brush head, but its “microvibrations” felt much weaker than the vibrations of the Philips Sonicare 4100.
The AquaSonic Vibe is the closest to a lower-priced Philips Sonicare dupe we’ve found. It has so far survived our dunk, drop, and battery tests, plus more than nine months of twice-daily use. Although its replacement heads are less expensive, we found that they require more-frequent replacement in comparison with Philips Sonicare refills. Plus, you need to register the brush to receive one year of warranty coverage.
As wth the Philips One by Sonicare, the vibrations of the AquaSonic Icon were weaker than what our pick produced.
The Bitvae D2 has a slightly slimmer body and a slightly thicker brush head than the Philips Sonicare 4100. It’s often on sale for around $20, including two years’ worth of replacement brush heads. But many buyer reviews cite recharging problems after just a few months.
The Burst Original and Burst Pro toothbrushes and replacement brush heads cost more than the Philips Sonicare 4100 and its refills. The Pro version has a pressure sensor, whereas the Original model does not.
The Burst Curve, positioned as a travel-friendly model, vibrates as much in its neck and handle as in its brush head, making for an uncomfortable brushing experience.
Greater Goods’s Sonic Electric Toothbrush is inexpensive compared with the Philips Sonicare 4100, and the backs of its brush heads are covered in a rubber-like material, which minimizes the potential for jarring mouth rattling as some testers experienced with our runner-up pick. However, the replacement heads come in only one style and are smaller than average, plus they required more frequent replacement in our testing.
Testers found that the GuruNanda Cruiser’s neck and body vibrated just as much as the brush head, making brushing uncomfortable.
The Laifen Wave’s brush heads felt flimsy and could be difficult to attach firmly. To change the brush’s three settings, within which there are 10 levels each of intensity, speed, and oscillation, you have to use the Laifen app.
We haven’t tested the Mode Electric Toothbrush, which—for roughly three times the cost of our picks—offers wireless charging and an optional night-light.
The Moon Electric Toothbrush is more expensive than our picks. Several owner reviews have alleged charger failure. We found the charger case exceptionally difficult to open.
The rechargeable Quip and Quip Smart toothbrushes are less powerful than our picks. In effect, the Quip brush is a manual toothbrush that vibrates—weakly. With it, you still need to perform brush strokes over the surface of every tooth in order to get a complete clean. In fact, manual “strokes per minute” is one of the Quip app’s performance readouts when paired with a Quip Smart brush. “Sonic bristles help clean,” Quip says, “but you need to put them in the right places by stroking them back and forth in short, tooth-sized strokes on all surfaces of every tooth, one by one.”
The Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush is a gorgeous brush with a mostly metal body, each component of which the company claims is repairable. (By contrast, cracking open an Oral-B or Philips Sonicare toothbrush handle often voids its warranty.) Like our top pick and runner-up, the Suri brush has a two-minute timer with quadrant pacing and a simple, one-button interface. Although the included magnetic wall mount is a nice touch, giving you a place to store a charged-up brush somewhere other than your countertop, in our testing we found that this model’s motor produced weaker vibrations in comparison with the Philips Sonicare 4100, with significant buzzing in the handle. There’s only one type of replacement brush head, available only through the company’s website; Suri accepts spent brush heads for free recycling. The Suri brush is warrantied for one year (a year less than the coverage on our picks), and the company offers a 100-day money-back guarantee. Claims related to device repair and replacement that you make after the warranty expires may involve varying fees.
The Waterpik Sensonic is double the price of the 4100, and its refills cost nearly $10 each. One tester found its bristles and vibration intensity to be especially abrasive.
If you typically use an electric toothbrush and a water flosser, replacing two separate tools with a combination electric toothbrush and water flosser like the Waterpik Sonic-Fusion 2.0 might seem appealing. In practice, however, we’ve found that it’s better to use separate devices. Replacement heads for this Waterpik brush cost over $12 each, making them some of the most expensive we’ve considered.
In general, U-shaped (or mouth-guard-style) brushes like the Y-Brush NylonStart and Autobrush Sonic Pro are much more costly and may be less effective than traditional electric toothbrushes.

The Best Office Chairs
Many cheap office chairs can make you feel as if you’ve been crammed into a torturous economy seat on a cross-country flight. But quality office chairs give you an upgrade to first class—they’re designed to support your body comfortably for the long haul.
We’ve researched dozens of office chairs, interviewed four ergonomics experts, and asked test panelists (with a variety of body types) to sit in deliberation for more than 175 collective hours.
Since 2015, we’ve found that the Steelcase Gesture is the best office chair for most people.
Everything we recommend
Top pick
This is one of the most adjustable chairs available—anyone can make it comfortable, regardless of their height or size. And it’s built to last.
Runner-up
This chair has more-limited armrest adjustability than our top pick, but it’s also more breathable and just as comfortable. And it comes in three sizes, so it fits a wider range of body types than most one-size-fits-all chairs.
Also great
This chair is as supportive and comfortable as many models that are twice the price, but it’s lacking some advanced adjustment features. It’s also the most visually distinctive model we tested.
Budget pick
This chair—one of the most comfortable we’ve tested—retails for under $500 and has many of the adjustments generally reserved for pricier chairs. But we don’t think it will last as long as our other picks.
Testing notes
- Comfort
We judged office chairs on seat, backrest, and armrest comfort, as well as on seat and arm-height adjustability.
- Lumbar and back support
A good backrest should support you regardless of the angle you sit at.
- Durability and quality
If a chair’s material seems cheap or feels as if it could crack under stress on day one, chances are good that it will be utterly destroyed by day 500.
- Warranty
We look for office chairs with at least a five-year warranty (though longer is better) that covers just about anything that breaks.
Top pick
This is one of the most adjustable chairs available—anyone can make it comfortable, regardless of their height or size. And it’s built to last.
The Steelcase Gesture costs more than $1,000, but if you sit for long periods, the expense is well worth it.
Across multiple test panels, involving dozens of staffers trying out office chairs, the Gesture has continued to be a favorite since we first recommended it, in 2015.
It’s one of the most comfortable, supportive, and durable office chairs we’ve ever tested. Everything has stood the test of time—from the back support to the quality fabric to the dependable adjustment knobs.
And of the chairs we tested, the Gesture offers the widest range of fabrics and other finishing options, so you can customize its appearance to your liking.
Runner-up
This chair has more-limited armrest adjustability than our top pick, but it’s also more breathable and just as comfortable. And it comes in three sizes, so it fits a wider range of body types than most one-size-fits-all chairs.
The Herman Miller Aeron Chair is iconic, comfortable, and durable. And if you run hot, the mesh back and seat make it a better option than the Steelcase Gesture.
Bottom line: If you mainly want a chair that props you up ergonomically and is comfortable to sit in for long hours of typing at a desk, the Aeron will suit you well.
The Aeron’s armrests aren’t as adjustable as the Gesture’s, so this chair is not as versatile for different tasks requiring arm support, such as propping up a tablet to read. But the Aeron is easier to move around and less bulky than the Gesture, and it doesn’t collect as much lint.
This chair is well known for its durability, and it comes with a 12-year warranty. If the price seems too high, you can probably find a lightly used Aeron—for a steep discount—at an office-furniture liquidation store.
The Aeron comes in three sizes, so we recommend checking the fit guide (PDF) before you order.
Also great
This chair is as supportive and comfortable as many models that are twice the price, but it’s lacking some advanced adjustment features. It’s also the most visually distinctive model we tested.
If our top picks are out of your desired price range, the Herman Miller Sayl Chair provides similar comfort and durability—for nearly half the price.
The Sayl is not as adjustable as the Steelcase Gesture, but it still satisfied test panelists of various sizes and heights.
As a high-quality chair with strong lumbar support, the Sayl is a good fit for someone performing standard office work—and its plastic webbed back stays cooler than fabric cushions.
This chair looks like no other model. If you’re into the space-age design, the Sayl comes in a range of color options, to make it blend in or stand out.
Budget pick
This chair—one of the most comfortable we’ve tested—retails for under $500 and has many of the adjustments generally reserved for pricier chairs. But we don’t think it will last as long as our other picks.
If you’re looking for something more affordable than our other picks, the HON Ignition 2.0 is the best inexpensive office chair we’ve tested.
It has all of the standard adjustments we like to see in a chair, including seat depth, tilt tension, tilt lock, seat height, and arm height.
It’s comfortable for all-day use, with effective, adjustable lumbar support (make sure the product description says “adjustable lumbar” so you get the model with that option).
However, this chair has a minimum seat height of 17 inches, so people of below-average height may have difficulty sitting properly with their feet flat on the floor (we recommend a footrest). Also, the Ignition 2.0 isn’t as sturdy as our pricier picks, and we don’t think it will last nearly as long.
Why you should trust us
Senior staff writer Kaitlyn Wells has spent the past decade working in hybrid and remote office environments, and she understands the importance of having a great office chair. While covering Wirecutter’s home-office beat, she’s tested everything from standing desks and printers to paper planners and dictation software.
Senior staff writer Melanie Pinola has tested dozens of office chairs, as well as other ergonomic products such as under-desk footrests and laptop stands, for Wirecutter since 2019. Prior to joining Wirecutter, she covered technology and productivity for over a dozen years for sites such as Consumer Reports, Lifehacker, PCWorld, and Laptop Magazine.
Who this is for
Buying an office chair is like buying a mattress: If you’re spending a third of your life sitting or lying on an item, it had better support your well-being and not break your back. If you have a full-time desk job, 14,000 hours is the minimum amount of time you’ll spend sitting over the next 10 years. (That’s assuming you sit in a chair for at least 35 hours a week, which you really shouldn’t do.)
We now know that any sustained in-chair time can be detrimental to your health, but a bad chair only adds to the problem by putting you in positions that add to long-term risk. If you have a home office, finding a chair that makes your desk time more comfortable and healthful is a worthwhile endeavor.
If you don’t spend that much time sitting in front of a computer, you don’t need the type of ergonomic, adjustability-focused office chair like the ones we recommend here. If you sit down only occasionally to check email or play games, buy the chair you feel most comfortable in or like the look of. Many people are happy to briefly work while sitting on a dining-room chair or a sofa. This guide is for people who work full-time from an office chair.
How we picked and tested
Before each round of testing, we scour manufacturers’ sites to look for any new models, and we comb through older versions of this guide to reevaluate our picks and previous dismissals. We also consult ergonomics experts to get advice on what to look for in an office chair that would best support your body for short or long periods of sitting. We use the following criteria to decide which chairs to test:
- Comfort: Finding the perfect, most comfortable office chair is a subjective endeavor that also depends on the type of work you do, your body size, and how you sit. Although many office chairs have a 300-pound weight limit, most of our picks have 350- or 400-pound capacities, and in our latest round of testing, our panelists included paid testers who have above-average heights and weights. We evaluated office chairs based on seat, backrest, and armrest comfort. How we felt after we got up from a chair was just as important as how we felt while we were sitting.
- Lumbar and back support: Because people have different torso lengths and lumbar curvatures, adjustability is key, according to professor Alan Hedge, an ergonomics expert. A good backrest will support you regardless of how you sit.
- Ease of reclining: Reclining is important for “sustainable sitting,” according to our experts, because you can move your body a bit more while you’re seated.
- Adjustability: A more-adjustable chair ensures a better fit for a wider range of bodies—and it’s more likely you’ll be happy with the chair you buy. Good chairs offer adjustable seat height, arm height, tilt, and seat depth. The best chairs allow you to customize the tilt distance and the amount of force needed to lean the chair back.
- Durability and materials: A lot of minor things can go wrong with a chair—the arms could come loose, a knob could crack, or a piece might break off entirely. Cheaper chairs are notorious for developing weird squeaks and creaking sounds over time. Seat cushions in particular can give out quickly, with the cheaper foam leaving you with an office chair that feels saggy. For those who like to move around while working, caster quality is also important.
- Price: Office chairs below $200 are made with cheaper plastic and metal, tend to have fixed armrests and seat depths, and usually look bland and have inferior warranties. Starting at around $300, chairs are more adjustable and built with high-quality materials. And at $1,000, there are more color and accessory options and even higher-end materials and finer adjustments for lumbar support.
- Warranty: Though a typical no-name chair might be covered for one or two years, most high-end chairs come with at least a 10-year warranty. We look for office chairs that come with a warranty of at least five years, but preferably longer. Expensive chairs also have warranties that cover just about anything that breaks, whereas the warranties for cheaper chairs don’t cover normal wear and tear.
- Appearance: We prioritize comfort over appearance, but not everyone will be happy with the bland blacks and grays of most office furniture. We ask our panelists what they think about the aesthetics of each chair they try; we consider fabric choice, color, and other customization options to be a bonus.
Based on our conversations with ergonomists, we avoided two types of chairs entirely:
- Executive-style chairs: Physiotherapist and seating historian Jenny Pynt told us to avoid “executive-style” chairs, those that “force your upper spine, that part between the shoulder blades, forward.” You should choose something that’s supporting your back, not sculpting it.
- Chairs that lack backrests or have partial backrests: Pynt also warned us against stools and other seats without backrests, at least as full-time accommodations, “because no matter how virtuous you are, you will slump.”
In our testing, each panelist evaluates chairs on the above criteria using a modified version of this ergonomic seating evaluation form (PDF) from Cornell University. And each panelist evaluates the chairs on all of the criteria, on a scale from 0 (unacceptable) to 10 (excellent).
Testers assess comfort, body support, adjustability, and durability, and they sit in the chairs while typing at computers, playing video games, writing emails, sitting through meetings, and just leaning back to think.
We’ve also gathered long-term testing notes on the chairs staffers were using for months in our offices.
Our pick: Steelcase Gesture
Top pick
This is one of the most adjustable chairs available—anyone can make it comfortable, regardless of their height or size. And it’s built to last.
With plenty of adjustability for a wide range of body types, the Steelcase Gesture is the best and most comfortable office chair for most people.
It’s supremely comfortable. After sitting in various other office chairs during testing, going back to the Gesture was, as one panelist put it, “like going to the spa.”
Impressively, the panelists scored the Gesture highest across all of our criteria. And they said that compared with seat cushions on similar chairs, the Gesture’s cushion hit the right balance of firmness and plushness; it was far better than seat cushions on budget chairs, which were almost-like-sitting-on-a-wooden-chair firm.
Wirecutter staffers who own the Gesture have confirmed that the cushion, back padding, and armrests are as comfortable after five years of heavy use as they were on day one.
It’s versatile, supportive, and packed with features. This chair is comfortable across multiple tasks, as confirmed by our testing panel, which included writers, editors, and photographers with different body types.
This chair’s lumbar and back support are on a par with that of other chairs in this price range—in other words, excellent. But the Gesture stands out due to how comfortable it is to recline in and how easy it is to vary your position. The backs on most other chairs tilt when you recline, but the Gesture’s back is designed to flex, as well, since your spine has a different shape when you’re reclining versus when you’re sitting up straight.
Our testers agreed that the Gesture’s recline experience was one of the most comfortable among all the chairs we tested. That’s because the Gesture retains the recline angle, so you don’t have to continue pushing back with your feet or your core to maintain that angle (as you must do with most other chairs).
It offers more and better adjustments than the competition. The Gesture is easy to maneuver and adjust to exactly the right configuration for your task and body type. You can move the seat depth forward and backward, change tilt tension, adjust how far back the chair can lean, and move the seat up and down.
The Gesture is also the only chair we tested with ball-and-socket armrests that you can move into nearly any position. We found the Gesture’s arm support useful when we were playing games, reclining to read, and leaning over a tablet to draw for long hours.
It looks good and lasts a long time. Testers appreciated the Gesture’s minimalist appearance, which is great for a professional setting or when you want your home office to feel more professional.
Steelcase’s 12-year warranty (PDF) covers everything that typically can go wrong with chairs, including any problems in the pneumatic cylinders (which enable the height adjustment). And in our testing, over years of heavy use, the Gesture has proved sturdy.
The Gesture is undeniably expensive. But if you don’t care about getting specific colors (the customized version offers more than 70 fabric options plus six leather ones), you can often find this chair for less than $500 at office liquidators online or locally. You lose the warranty if you buy the chair used, but the savings may make the trade-off worth it.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
- If you run hot, work in an office without air conditioning, or live in a warm part of the world, the Gesture may not be the best chair for you because the foam and fabric don’t breathe well. All of our other picks have mesh backs, which are much more breathable and also less likely to collect lint.
- The Gesture is not the ergonomic revolution that Steelcase’s marketing materials suggest: Fancy armrests aside, most ergonomic task chairs in the $1,000 to $1,500 range will have similar features and back support. What sets the Gesture apart is that it excels for those who want to recline with little effort, switch tasks throughout the day, or easily make adjustments to fine-tune the fit.
- This chair weighs over 70 pounds, which can be annoying if you want to move it around your home office. But that also makes it super sturdy.
How the Steelcase Gesture has held up
It has held up incredibly well in terms of parts and materials, especially considering I treat my chair kind of like a sofa. I’m 6-foot-4 and shift my weight around a lot. All of the movements are great and super helpful. Minor criticism: It’s super heavy. Also, the center column sits very close to the floor, meaning there’s not a lot of clearance if you have a thicker rug or need to roll over something on occasion. —Michael Hession, Wirecutter’s director of photography, owner of the Steelcase Gesture since 2020
I sit in the Steelcase Gesture for my full workday and sometimes for hours after to play PC games, and it's held up great under thousands of hours of sitting. In October 2021—at least 6 years and more than 10,000 hours of sitting—I noticed that the seat felt stiff, especially compared to my partner's comparatively new Gesture. I reached out to customer support to ask for a replacement part, and after sending in a video of the seat's condition, they shipped me a seat replacement for free under the chair's lifetime warranty. The new seat took maybe 5 minutes to install, and it made the whole chair feel brand new. — Kimber Streams, Wirecutter senior staff writer, owner of the Steelcase Gesture since 2015.
Runner-up: Herman Miller Aeron Chair
Runner-up
This chair has more-limited armrest adjustability than our top pick, but it’s also more breathable and just as comfortable. And it comes in three sizes, so it fits a wider range of body types than most one-size-fits-all chairs.
The Herman Miller Aeron Chair is a well-built, highly adjustable model. And it may be a more comfortable option than the Steelcase Gesture for people who run hot, thanks to its mesh seat and back.
Its mesh design is surprisingly supportive. Some of our testers likened using the Aeron to sitting in a hammock, since the springy material almost suspends you as you sit.
The mesh seat and back make the Aeron a better option than foam upholstered chairs for those who live in a warm climate or sweat easily.
It’s not as adjustable as the Gesture, but it’s still more customizable than most chairs. First, the good: The Aeron has most of the ergonomic adjustments we want to see in a high-end chair, including a fully adjustable lumbar-support system and arms that go up and down and angle in and out.
However, it falls short of the Gesture in several key ways. The Aeron’s armrests aren’t as adjustable, and reclining isn’t as effortless. You cannot adjust the seat depth, either, and the arm height is a pain to change. This may be especially frustrating to people who switch tasks throughout the day.
It comes in three sizes to suit different body types. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, the Aeron comes in different sizes (PDF), labeled A, B, and C. The sizes roughly correlate to ascending height and weight ranges, and even though you might not find a size that fits you perfectly, you should still look at the size chart and consider what makes sense for you.
One of our testers, right on the cusp of sizes B (medium) and C (large) in the chart, found the size B chair far too narrow, and the recline was too easy to push back accidentally. When in doubt, we recommend sizing up.
It’s ideal for desk work, and it enforces proper posture. Try to sit with your legs crossed in an Aeron, and you’ll immediately find it uncomfortable. Do so on the Steelcase Gesture, and you might totally forget that your legs are crossed until you stand up. For some people, the Aeron’s forced ergonomics are nice, but others might find the chair to be too prescriptive.
It has a classic look that has stood the test of time. The Aeron has an iconic design, one that has been widely imitated. Our panelists remarked that the gray (called “mineral”) model we tested looked less monolithic than the black version, and they thought it might blend in better in some homes. You can also splurge on options, such as a polished or satin aluminum frame, to spruce it up a little.
It has a long warranty and excellent durability, and it’s widely available. The Aeron comes with a 12-year warranty covering all repairs and parts. Many of these parts are easy to replace yourself; unlike the Gesture (which hides its moving parts), the Aeron wears its skeleton proudly. It’s easy to see the exact bolts you need to remove to replace a piece.
Compared with the Gesture, the Aeron feels much more durable and harder to break—it’s mostly metal, hard plastic, and mesh. (Wirecutter editor Thorin Klosowski has had a classic Aeron for over a decade and has moved with it many times, including twice to different states, and it still looks brand new.)
Because the Aeron is so popular, you can often find older or lightly used ones at a substantial discount from office liquidators or even on Craigslist.
Also great: Herman Miller Sayl Chair
Also great
This chair is as supportive and comfortable as many models that are twice the price, but it’s lacking some advanced adjustment features. It’s also the most visually distinctive model we tested.
Starting at well under $1,000, the Herman Miller Sayl Chair is a good compromise between a cheap budget chair and a high-end one.
It’s adjustable enough for most people. The Sayl doesn’t have the less common adjustments you’d get with the Steelcase Gesture. But it does offer the basic ergonomic customization most people need—especially if you get the optional adjustable armrests (which can slide up or down, in or out, or diagonally inward or outward).
The Sayl offers tilt tension and distance adjustment, but it takes a few turns of the tension knob before you really notice a change. And one of our size C testers found it was too easy to lean all the way back in this chair.
Most people will find that the Sayl’s fixed seat depth (16 inches) supports their thighs well enough. But if you need adjustability, an adjustable-depth option lets you push the seat out to 18 inches (for about $800 more).
It’s comfortable for all-day sitting. The rubber mesh back moves and stretches with you as you shift into it, and as the day goes on, it provides plenty of support for the S-shaped curve of your spine. Our smaller testers especially liked this chair.
You can purchase an optional adjustable lumbar-support control that slides up and down on the back. However, most of our testers found this piece to be unnecessary because the Sayl naturally forces you to sit upright.
The seat is upholstered in high-quality fabric, and it has a firm cushion that feels like it will last a long time. But if you prefer a softer, cushier seat, the Steelcase Gesture would be a better option for you.
It stands out in a crowd. The Sayl’s unframed rubber back has an unusual look that catches the eye. (It’s so distinctive-looking that it was even used in The Hunger Games.) You can pick from among several colors for the back mesh, base, and seat fabric.
Of course, design is a matter of personal preference. Some panelists loved the “alien/space-age” look of the chair while others hated it. During testing, we referred to the Sayl as the Tron chair.
It has the same durability and long warranty as the Aeron. This chair is made of softer plastics and has less metal than the Aeron, but it comes with the same 12-year warranty and will still hold up over time.
We’ve been regularly using Sayl chairs since 2018, and they have generally maintained their smooth adjustments and looks, though the arm movements can be clunky on occasion. In testing, we were concerned about the plastic back ripping, but it has been remarkably sturdy.
How the Herman Miller Sayl Chair has held up
Budget pick: HON Ignition 2.0
Budget pick
This chair—one of the most comfortable we’ve tested—retails for under $500 and has many of the adjustments generally reserved for pricier chairs. But we don’t think it will last as long as our other picks.
The HON Ignition 2.0 is the best budget option we’ve found. It’s comfortable to sit in, and it offers the best lumbar support of any chair we’ve tested under $500.
It’s more durable than other chairs at this price. The Ignition 2.0’s materials feel more durable and of a higher quality than those of similarly priced competitors, and it has less wobbly armrests and smoother-rolling casters.
It’s the most comfortable budget chair we’ve tested. The seat cushion is thick and soft, and you don’t have to break it in. At the end of a long day, it still feels supportive, unlike too-soft seats that you’d sink into over time.
Compared with the back on the Aeron (which has a tight weave that feels like a trampoline for your posterior), the back on the Ignition 2.0 feels more like a camping chair you sink into. And we think the Ignition 2.0’s armrests, which consist of a soft plastic with light cushioning, will last a while.
Although the Ignition 2.0 doesn’t compare in overall comfort to the Steelcase Gesture or the Aeron, it at least gets all the basics right.
Its lumbar support really works. Most office chairs claim to offer lumbar support, but more often than not it’s nonexistent. The Ignition 2.0’s optional adjustable lumbar support actually works and is noticeable: When our testers moved the back support up or down, it stayed in place and provided extra support where they needed it.
It offers lots of other adjustments. You can move the seat depth in and out, change the seat height, and telescope the arms up and down as well as away from or toward your torso.
The arms don’t go down as far as those on the Gesture, the Aeron, or the Sayl. But many other budget chairs provide no armrest adjustments at all (which some of our testers noted as a dealbreaker, after sitting in 10 different chairs).
Because of its higher-than-average minimum seat height, this chair is not a great fit if you’re petite. One 5-foot-2 tester found it impossible to keep her feet flat on the floor while sitting in the chair at its lowest height. A footrest easily solves that problem, albeit at an added cost.
It has stylish, minimalist good looks, and it comes in different materials and sizes. The Ignition 2.0 looks less boxy than competing budget-priced chairs, and it’s available with a gray or black mesh back.
HON offers different task chairs in the Ignition series: the mesh-back Ignition 2.0, which we tested; the Ignition, which is a fully upholstered chair; and a Big and Tall Ignition, which supports up to 450 pounds but usually costs more than double the price of the Ignition 2.0.
It’s well built and has a solid warranty. The Ignition 2.0 comes with a limited lifetime warranty that covers defective materials or workmanship. But it doesn’t cover minor parts wearing out (as the Steelcase and Herman Miller warranties do).
That said, the Ignition 2.0 seems like it will be a little more durable than most chairs in this price range. The frame is mostly hard, matte plastic, and the casters roll smoothly. And the seat cushion is covered with a thick woven fabric (though it’s obviously less premium, with a looser weave, than that of the Gesture).
How the HON Ignition 2.0 has held up
Other good office chairs
If you want a high-end chair, but you don’t have quite the budget for a Steelcase or Herman Miller model: Consider the ergoCentric tCentric Hybrid.
Like the $1,000-plus chairs we recommend, this one (which is designed and built in Canada) has tons of configuration options, comes with a 12-year warranty, and feels made to last.
The chair we tested has a wide range of ergonomic adjustments. And it even has some unusual features, such as armrests that can spin 360 degrees, an inflatable lumbar-support cushion, and a built-in adjustable headrest.
We don’t love the lateral armrest adjustment: It doesn’t have a lock and thus tends to slip under the hands when you’re standing up from the chair. But you can opt for armrests that just swivel and lift (and save some money in the process).
The tCentric Hybrid is generally less expensive than a comparably equipped Steelcase Gesture or Herman Miller Aeron. But this chair doesn’t have the Gesture’s cleverly designed recline mechanism or the Aeron’s iconic looks, and ergoCentric lacks the long-standing reputations of those companies.
If you want Steelcase’s most attractive ergonomic feature in a less-expensive chair: Check out the Steelcase Karman.
This lightweight mesh chair has a design that’s a bit like the Herman Miller Aeron, with its solid frame and scalloped seat. It also boasts the same flexible reclining experience as the Steelcase Gesture, but starts at $850 (at this writing), undercutting the Gesture by at least $250.
It has fewer adjustments overall than the Gesture. You raise or lower the seat, and can get it with height-adjustable or four-way adjustable armrests, as well as optional added lumbar support. For most people, these will be enough. But if you need more, consider our Steelcase or Herman Miller picks.
We found it comfortable, cool, and supportive to sit in, though the rubberized seat frame may annoy people who like to sit cross-legged. Like the Aeron, this is a chair that teaches you how to sit properly, whether you like it or not.
If you want a mesh chair with a headrest and highly adjustable lumbar support: The Razer Fujin Pro is worth a look.
Billed as a “fully adjustable mesh gaming and desk chair” by gaming company Razer, the Fujin Pro can support you for long stints of gameplay or work (or both). Its all-mesh design begs a comparison with the Herman Miller Aeron or the Steelcase Gesture; the Fujin Pro stands out mostly for its included headrest for neck and head support while reclining and height- and depth-adjustable lumbar support.
We found it easy to dial the lumbar support inwards or outwards to customize its comfort, and although the armrests don’t have as much range of motion as the Steelcase Gesture, we appreciated the locks on the Fujin Pro to keep the armrests in place. The chair doesn’t offer as snug of a fit as the Aeron, which is a matter of preference, and one panelist (6-foot-6 and over 300 pounds) said the back edge of the seat was uncomfortable for him.
The Fujin Pro has a relatively short 5-year warranty for a chair that costs over $1,000.
If you want an extra roomy seat and support for up to 400 pounds: Take a look at the Staples Driscott Ergonomic Fabric Managers Big & Tall Chair.
This chair’s seat is a couple of inches wider and deeper than our picks and other chairs we’ve tested (it measures 23.6 inches wide by 19.9 inches deep). That made it an instant hit with our testers who are above average in height and weight (for men, average is: 5-foot-9 and 200 pounds; for women: 5-foot-4 and 171 pounds), as well as panelists who said they often like to sit cross-legged at their desks. We found the seat to be plushy and comfortable, although the armrests were not as comfortable as other chairs because of its minimal padding.
Adjustments on the chair are minimal as well: the seat and arms go up and down, and the lumbar support has a depth dial that didn’t make any noticeable difference.
Like the Steelcase Gesture, the Driscott has a relatively high 400-pound weight capacity. This budget chair also offers a limited lifetime warranty, but note that Staples’ furniture return window is 14 days.
If you want a more-stylish budget chair and can live with wiggly armrests: The Branch Ergonomic Chair is another option worth considering.
This chair has a thick, well-padded seat, like on the HON Ignition 2.0. And, like the Fully Desk Chair, it has premium design features, including an aluminum base and a few different color options for the frame and seat.
But even though we liked this chair’s solid lumbar support, its armrests were wobblier than those on other chairs in its price range.
What to look forward to
We’re expecting new, yet-to-be-publicly-announced ergonomic chairs from Branch and Allseating in the near future. We’ll update this guide once we’ve had a chance to test them.
We’re also looking into chairs designed for petite people, with low minimum heights and short seat depths, from brands such as Steelcase and BTOD.
The competition
The Branch Verve is a generally comfortable, flexible chair that comes in eye-catching colors like coral pink and sage green. But starting at $550, it costs much more than Branch’s own $350 Ergonomic Chair, which offers a wider range of ergonomic adjustments and can be outfitted with a head rest. We found the seat’s gentle forward slope (which Branch told us is an ergonomic feature) slightly unsettling, since it gave us the vague feeling that we were about to slide off. And we didn’t like the arm design, either. If you pull on an arm (say, to move the chair), it easily extends to its full height. The problem is, this is also how you unlock the arm, which sends it sliding all the way back down to its lowest position. For us, at least, that meant we were constantly readjusting the arms to our preferred height.
We had a similar experience comparing the Hon Nucleus to its sibling and our budget pick, the HON Ignition 2.0—the more expensive Nucleus didn’t seem to offer significant advantages over the Ignition 2.0 except for coming in a couple of pleasant, neutral colorways. The Nucleus’s foam seat sits on a mesh-covered frame, which the company says offers a hammock-like feel; it’s comfortable to sit in especially if you like firmer support, but we didn’t experience the implied suspended bliss of the seat design.
We weren’t able to test the Shaquille O’Neal Nereus Executive Chair, which has a high 400-pound weight limit and tall maximum seat height to accommodate basketball players or people as big as them. The chair arrived with a broken seat handle; we were also concerned about the bonded leather’s durability.
The Hon Ignition 2.0 Big & Tall Task Chair came with a missing chair lift cylinder, so we were unable to test that as well.
We found the FlexiSpot C7’s seat comfortable, but the chair was more difficult to adjust than our picks, its protruding lumbar support section was awkward to sit against, the fold-out footrest felt flimsy, and the chair rolled everywhere on its own while we were sitting in it.
The X-Chair X3 ATR Management Chair with Elemax has a lot of interesting-sounding features, but it’s just an okay chair. The backrest and lumbar support didn’t adjust high enough, and they were prone to slipping out of position. There’s a free kit that allows users to screw the lumbar support in place (video), but this seems like a less-than-ideal solution for a chair that’s nearly $1,000. Testers also found that the dual-mode massage function didn’t work very well.
The All33 BackStrong C1 Chair (now replaced by the similar Axion) is the most unusual chair we’ve ever tested, with a seat and a lower-back area that pivot separately from the upper-back area—a design created by a chiropractor to support and encourage movement of “all 33” vertebrae in your lower spine. This was effective in engaging our core muscles when we moved in the chair. But the construction is plasticky, and the armrests aren’t adjustable. And it has a high minimum seat height, so this chair isn’t suitable for people who are under about 5-foot-8.
The HON Convergence’s seat is too squishy, with thin fabric, and its mid- to upper-back support was not as good as that of the HON Ignition 2.0.
The HON Exposure is a fine chair, but the Ignition 2.0 has a more comfortable seat, better lumbar support, a higher weight capacity, and a less-boxy design for about the same retail price.
The Herman Miller Cosm Chair (available in low-, mid-, and high-back versions) is designed to shift and move with you. It costs about the same as the Aeron, and our panelists scored it well for comfort, back support, ease of reclining, and overall appearance. But in all those categories, the Aeron still edged out the Cosm by a hair.
The Steelcase Silq’s design philosophy is similar to that of the Herman Miller Cosm. But we found the Silq to be less comfortable than other, comparable chairs to sit in for long periods of time. One size C tester found that the Silq pushed them forward in an uncomfortable way and that the armrests dug into them.
Humanscale’s Freedom Task Chair is compact and offers plenty of finishes, but our panelists rated it just average across most of the categories, including comfort, back support, and adjustment ease. It also has a very firm seat.
The Autonomous ErgoChair 2 (now called the ErgoChair Pro) combines a mesh back and a foam seat for a relatively low price, yet it was our panelists’ least favorite chair. One tester said that sitting in it for 90 minutes “felt like an eternity,” and another remarked that this chair might motivate them to get a standing desk. The back pushes you forward more than is natural, the headrest is uncomfortable, and the adjustments are difficult to control.
IKEA’s Hattefjäll comes in gray, pink, or white and has a fun, curvy design. But we found the foam seat too firm and potentially prone to collecting excess dust, lint, and other detritus. Because of its size, this chair is also best suited to petite people.
The AmazonBasics Mid-Back Mesh Office Chair is the least expensive model we’ve tested, with fixed armrests and a one-year warranty. Our petite-size testers had difficulty sitting in this chair comfortably and getting full back support because of the seat-pan depth. Others complained about the firm seat and the limited recline. Ultimately, we think you’re better off saving for a more comfortable chair that will last longer.
The Steelcase Leap is an excellent chair with ample adjustments and a comfortable back. But most of our testers didn’t find anything about the Leap that separated it from the Steelcase Gesture or the Herman Miller Aeron.
The Haworth Fern was the favorite of a couple of testers. But because of its high back, others couldn’t get comfortable in it, no matter how hard they tried.
Herman Miller’s Embody Chair is a strange-looking model, yet it’s comfortable, highly adjustable, and high-tech. However, its starting price is even higher than the Gesture’s, and it lacks the Gesture’s arm adjustability and fabric variety.
The Herman Miller Mirra 2 Chair is a good office model, and it’s priced comparably to the Aeron. But we think the Aeron is a better chair, with a more comfortable seat and better tilt controls.
The Steelcase Amia ranked highly for some testers, but its unremarkable design and limited features keep it from truly excelling.
The Steelcase Think is similar to the Amia in that none of our testers found it terrible, yet only one person put it in their top three. It’s inoffensive, and because it has a mesh back, it will be breathable in the heat. However, we think most people should get the similarly priced Gesture instead.
Some testers found the Knoll ReGeneration uncomfortable to sit in: They complained about the back of the chair pushing awkwardly on their lower spine. Others found the recline, which shoves your crotch into the air as you push back, a little awkward.
None of our testers liked the Steelcase Series 1. They complained that it was too short, the arms were too tall, and it was generally uncomfortable to sit in for longer than a couple of hours at a time.
The IKEA Markus was universally reviled by our testing panel. Shorter testers said the high back made them feel like a kid sitting on a throne, while taller testers said the non-adjustable arms were far too low to be comfortable.
As part of our ongoing mission to recommend high-quality office chairs at different prices, we have considered a number of chairs under $300 that met our criteria for adjustability (lumbar support, height, seat depth, armrest, and tilt/tension) and that also had a warranty of at least five years. We dismissed the Staples Hyken Mesh Task Chair and the Office Star ProGrid Mesh Manager’s Chair for the lack of seat-depth adjustability. And we eliminated the Staples Kroy Mesh/Fabric Task Chair and the TribeSigns T18 Ergonomic Office Chair over concerns about a limited seat-height range (3 inches) or a too-high minimum seat height (over 18 inches).

Frequently asked questions
How long do desk chairs last?
How long any chair will last depends on how you use it. But the best chairs should last over a decade, while inexpensive ones may last only a year or two. High-end chairs, like our top pick and runner-up, are made with highly durable parts and fabrics. And they come with longer warranties (12 years for the Steelcase Gesture and the Herman Miller Aeron) that cover any issues outside normal wear and tear. Less expensive chairs, like those found at Wayfair and big-box retailers, come with one- or two-year warranties and use inferior materials.
Are expensive office chairs worth it?
Yes, if you spend most of your working hours sitting at your desk. A high-quality chair will last longer. And it will also provide more ergonomic controls, so you can customize your seating position to give your body the most support possible. Sitting for hours on end in a chair without proper support can result in lower-back, neck, and/or hip pain, which can impede your ability to work. Expensive chairs can also be bought secondhand (often in like-new condition) at significant discounts, so they are more accessible to more people.
Should I buy an office chair, a task chair, or a gaming chair?
Office chairs and task chairs are generally synonymous. However, in practice, usually the cheapest, smallest, least ergonomically sound office chairs are the ones sold as task chairs. Gaming chairs, meanwhile, resemble office chairs but generally provide fewer ergonomic adjustments. For instance, although a good gaming chair will offer lumbar support, its backrest is designed to cradle you as you play, rather than support an ideal seating position. Ergonomic concerns aside, gaming chairs also tend to make aesthetic choices that look good on a Twitch stream but may seem less appropriate in a Zoom meeting with your boss.
Where can I buy a cheap office chair?
A quick Google search for office chairs will turn up hundreds of models, many of which cost under $100 and can be found online at sites like Wayfair and Amazon or at big-box stores and office retailers like Target and Staples. Though most of those chairs may seem fine at first, you’ll soon be feeling (and hearing) the consequences of choosing a cheap chair: creaking sounds, deflated foam cushions, and cracking armrests and other plastic parts. Rather than spending $50 to $100 every year or two, you’re better off saving up to buy a well-made chair that will last.
If you can’t stomach the idea of spending $300 to $1,000 for an office chair, despite the benefits, look for a good used deal on one of our picks.
Does IKEA have good office chairs?
Over the years, we’ve tested a few office chairs from IKEA. And we’ve found that these chairs tend to lack adjustability, which can be a dealbreaker for many people. Our taller testers found the non-adjustable armrests on the budget-friendly IKEA Markus to be too short, and shorter testers thought the chair’s lowest seat position was still too high. The IKEA Hattefjäll comes in colorful fabrics and sports a fun, curvy design, but our testers found the seat too firm for prolonged sitting. We think you’re better off getting our budget pick, since it’s only about $40 more.

Blasting years of mildew off a piece of patio furniture provides a level of satisfaction that is attainable only with a pressure washer.
After more than 100 hours of research and years of testing and using pressure washers to clean cars, outdoor chairs, and more, we found that the best one for most homeowners is the Ryobi RY142500 Brushless 2500 PSI Pressure Washer.
Everything we recommend
Top pick
With extra-large wheels, a long hose, a high-end induction motor, and a well-designed GFCI plug, this Ryobi model is the most user-friendly electric pressure washer.
Runner-up
This DeWalt model is similar to our top pick from Ryobi in power and usability, and it has a broader selection of nozzles and wider tires. But the cord wrap is frustrating.
Budget pick
This less expensive model cleans comparably, but because it lacks several standout features, it’s much less convenient to use.
Also great
This Ryobi model doesn’t clean as quickly as the others, but its small size and top handle make it portable and easy to store.
Also great
This DeWalt model isn’t as powerful as some other pressure washers, but with its unique shape and smart wand, hose, and cord storage, it’s the easiest one to stow away.
Top pick
With extra-large wheels, a long hose, a high-end induction motor, and a well-designed GFCI plug, this Ryobi model is the most user-friendly electric pressure washer.
All the electric pressure washers (aka power washers) cleaned well in our tests, but the Ryobi RY142500 Brushless 2500 PSI Pressure Washer stood out for its durable motor, longer hose, larger wheels, better-designed cord, and lengthier warranty coverage in comparison with the competition.
The quiet-running brushless induction motor of the RY142500 should last for years, and in our tests the machine’s heft helped make it particularly hard to tip over, even when we were forcefully tugging on the hose. The RY142500 usually costs a little more than other pressure washers, but if you plan to use it three or more times a year, it’s the best value. This is a more powerful version of our previous pick, the Ryobi RY142300 2300 PSI Brushless Electric Pressure Washer, which has been discontinued.
Runner-up
This DeWalt model is similar to our top pick from Ryobi in power and usability, and it has a broader selection of nozzles and wider tires. But the cord wrap is frustrating.
If the Ryobi RY142500 is not available, we also like the DeWalt DWPW2400 2400 PSI Electric Cold-Water Pressure Washer. Similar to the Ryobi model in its body design, brushless motor, and overall power and usability, this DeWalt pressure washer also has some advantages: It comes with two additional nozzles, a detergent tank that is easier to monitor and empty, and wide pneumatic tires that can navigate more easily across bumpy lawns. But the holder for the spray wand is ineffective, and this model is usually more expensive than the Ryobi pressure washer.
Budget pick
This less expensive model cleans comparably, but because it lacks several standout features, it’s much less convenient to use.
If you have a smaller budget or plan to use your pressure washer only once or twice a year, we like the Sun Joe SPX3000 Electric Pressure Washer. It costs less than the Ryobi RY142500 and cleans about the same. But like most comparably priced models, it has a shorter hose, a lower-quality motor, smaller wheels, a shorter warranty, and a design that’s far easier to tip over. Compared with the other budget models we tried, it has a wider selection of spray nozzles and a tougher metal spray wand, plus convenient hose and cord storage.
Also great
This Ryobi model doesn’t clean as quickly as the others, but its small size and top handle make it portable and easy to store.
If you’re short on storage and you don’t mind carrying a pressure washer around, we also like the Ryobi RY1419MTVNM 1900 PSI Electric Pressure Washer. It’s much smaller than the other models we tested and has less oomph, but it can still handle most jobs (they might just take longer). It has wheels and a retractable handle, but weighing a little over 20 pounds, it’s compact enough for you to carry it as you would a duffel bag. This pressure washer has the same long hose as our main pick, too, but it lacks that model’s high-end induction motor and some of the other, finer details.
Also great
This DeWalt model isn’t as powerful as some other pressure washers, but with its unique shape and smart wand, hose, and cord storage, it’s the easiest one to stow away.
If easy storage is your top priority, we recommend the stowable, stackable DeWalt DWPW2100 2100 Max PSI Electric Jobsite Cold Water Pressure Washer. Its wand breaks down into three parts that are kept in an internal storage compartment, and the hose and cord are tucked behind the outer roll cage, one on each side. It’s small enough to carry around, and its retractable luggage handle and small onboard wheels help it roll more effectively than most. The DeWalt DWPW2100 is comparable to the Ryobi RY1419MTVNM in power, but it costs about twice as much, so the efficient storage comes at a price premium.

Why you should trust us
I’ve been reviewing tools and garage gear since 2007, and I spent 10 years in the building trades constructing high-end homes in the Boston area. For Wirecutter, I’ve written guides to lawn mowers, string trimmers, leaf blowers, and snow blowers, so I’m very familiar with the ins and outs of residential lawn and yard equipment. For this guide, I spent roughly 50 hours reading every pressure washer article I could find, looked over hundreds of customer reviews at various retailer sites, and spoke with a pressure washer expert who, at the time of our interview, had been involved with these machines for 17 years.
Who this is for
A pressure washer makes fast work of big cleaning projects (and small ones, too). Because water sprays from a washer’s nozzle with such intensity, it can lift up and remove dirt, mildew, and grime that a regular garden hose simply can’t handle. Cleanup jobs that would normally take 20 to 30 minutes with a garden hose and a sponge or wire brush take a fraction of the time with a pressure washer. During our testing, we cleaned a manure-covered wheelbarrow in a matter of minutes, and a set of ancient Adirondack chairs took maybe three or four minutes apiece. You get better results for less work, and the benefits increase as the jobs get bigger.
But you might not need to own one full time. Most rental centers have pressure washers available by the day or hour, so if you’re cleaning your siding once every two years, there’s no sense in buying one just to have it take up space in your garage. Once you start using it more than that—say, a couple of times a year—owning one begins to make sense. We checked a few rental centers around the country and found that the per-week rental charge was typically the cost of a new washer.
How we picked and tested
An electric pressure washer offers the best combination of power and convenience. Electric washers are not as powerful as gas washers, but they have plenty of strength for normal around-the-house jobs. They’re also cheaper and much easier to deal with: They need almost no maintenance, they start with the flip of a switch, and they’re simple to store in the offseason.
We’ve recommended a gas pressure washer in the past, and we’ve had one at our testing site for years, but over time we’ve realized that we simply don’t ever use it. A nice electric model, like our top pick, can handle most cleaning jobs. Electric washers take longer to clean an area, but we’d rather spend more time cleaning than deal with oil, fuel, exhaust, maintenance, off-season storage, and the other inconveniences of owning a gas engine.
Cleaning power is more than just a number. The capability of a pressure washer is determined by its pressure (measured in pounds per square inch, or psi) and flow (measured in gallons per minute, or gpm). “The psi pushes the organic matter from the surface, and the gpm carries it away,” explained Jamey Kramaric, who once ran PressureWashr.com. He told us the sweet spot for an electric washer’s pressure is in the 1,800 to 2,000 psi range, with a gpm volume of about 1.3 to 1.5. Multiplying these two numbers gives you what the pressure washer industry calls the cleaning units, or CU, of the washer, which is the most accurate way to compare how two washers perform against one another.
How you use the washer also affects how well it cleans. As Kramaric explained, “A little trick is to remember moving 2x further away will 1/2 the force the surface feels.” So just moving the nozzle lets you control the pressure. The weaker pressure washers can still get a lot clean, but with one of those models you need to do the job with the spray tip right up against the surface you’re spraying.
Induction motors are better than universal motors. An electric pressure washer with an induction motor is a little more expensive, but as Kramaric writes in an article comparing the two styles, “They are also more rugged, quieter and will have a longer lifespan.” In our testing, the induction motors emitted more of a humming, in contrast to the whine of the universal motors.
Convenience features are very important. We’ve learned to seek out models that have big wheels, metal spray wands, and effective hose and cord storage. These are the telltale signs of a tool that is likely to be easy to use and durable, and one that won’t cause additional frustrations. They do add cost, though: Basic models with minimal features and universal motors cost as little as $150, but more feature-laden washers with heavy-duty induction motors start at around $250 and top out around $400.
We tested by cleaning everything we could. To determine the best pressure washer, we washed six cars, a couple of sets of patio furniture, a lawn tractor, a brick chimney, three filthy wheelbarrows, some grime-covered pallets, a small soccer net, a garden cart, a maple-syrup evaporator, three rabbit cages, and some muddy extension cords. We also cleaned years of caked-on cow manure off an old, well-used Ford tractor. In addition, we’ve continued using our picks for all manner of around-the-house use.
Best overall pressure washer: Ryobi RY142500 Brushless 2500 PSI Electric Pressure Washer
Top pick
With extra-large wheels, a long hose, a high-end induction motor, and a well-designed GFCI plug, this Ryobi model is the most user-friendly electric pressure washer.
After all of our testing and research, we’re confident that the best pressure washer is the Ryobi RY142500 2500 PSI Electric Pressure Washer. It didn’t clean much faster or better than the other models during our testing, but its smart design touches avoid nearly all of the inconveniences commonly associated with pressure washers. This model replaces our previous pick, the Ryobi RY142300, which has been discontinued.
It cleans well (but they all do). The Ryobi RY142500’s pressure rating of 2,500 psi is high for an electric pressure washer, but it has a relatively low flow rate of 1.2 gpm, so its actual cleaning ability is on a par with that of the other models we tried. We’ve never found the power lacking: In our tests, this model managed to get blobs of pine sap off a car and push away a graying layer of mildew on patio furniture. And in our years of long-term testing, Ryobi’s electric pressure washer has always delivered enough power for the job at hand.
Its induction motor adds a number of advantages. Induction motors are quieter and last longer than the smaller universal motors found on the majority of residential pressure washers. They’re also larger and heavier. In the case of the well-balanced RY142500, the added weight acts as a stabilizer. Even when we gave the hose a good tug, we were unable to tip over the unit.
The hose, cord, and wand storage are better than most. To store the Ryobi RY142500, you loop both the hose and cord and attach them to the washer with either a Velcro strap (the hose) or a bungee (the cord). Because they’re not stored in a tight loop, as on so many other pressure washers, when unwound they lie relatively flat. The hose and cord are also of higher quality than those on most competing models. And the wand holder actually does the job of holding the wand, something that most wand holders seem to be incapable of doing.
Its big wheels can traverse any lawn. At nearly a foot in diameter, the Ryobi RY142500’s wheels are almost twice as large as the wheels on most electric pressure washers. This made the RY142500 one of the easiest washers to maneuver, especially when we traveled over an uneven lawn, hopped a curb, and bumped it up a set of patio steps. Most of the wheels on the other washers were so bad, we had to half drag and half carry them.
The plug can fit any outlet. Due to a pressure washer’s combination of water and electricity, all models come with a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) built into the power cord for added safety. The GFCI brick is always bulky, but Ryobi sets it several inches back from the plug end, which allows the plug to be normal size. Most other pressure washers have the GFCI built directly into the plug end, making them incompatible with covered exterior outlets.
Ryobi covers it with a three-year limited warranty. This is one of the longest warranties we found for an electric pressure washer. Ryobi tools are readily available at Home Depot too, and you can have any servicing done through that retailer as well, an option that adds to the overall convenience of this pressure washer.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
The soap dispenser is a problem. The Ryobi RY142500’s soap container is opaque, so you have no way to see how much detergent is left other than popping the cap off and taking a look. The cap is angled, so filling the container with detergent is difficult. But what’s worse is that the tank is bolted to the washer body, so to empty the tank, we had to tip the unit back and pull out the soap-supply hose on the underside of it. In doing this, it’s not easy to preserve the detergent for future use—in fact, we ended up just rolling the whole machine over on its side and dumping the detergent out on the lawn. Many other models have semi-opaque, removable tanks, with easy-to-access caps.
The nozzle selection and storage are a bit lacking. The Ryobi RY142500 comes with three nozzles (15-degree, soap, and a rotary turbo nozzle) but offers a place to store only two of them; this design decision assumes that one nozzle will always be on the tip of the wand. We would have liked to see a 40-degree nozzle, or at least a place to put one in case the owner purchases it separately. The previous version of this pressure washer had an extra storage spot, so it’s a bit of an unforced error for Ryobi not to include that on this newer model.
Runner-up: DeWalt DWPW2400 2400 PSI Electric Cold-Water Pressure Washer
Runner-up
This DeWalt model is similar to our top pick from Ryobi in power and usability, and it has a broader selection of nozzles and wider tires. But the cord wrap is frustrating.
Another pressure washer we like is the DeWalt DWPW2400 2400 PSI Electric Cold-Water Pressure Washer. This model is similar to the Ryobi RY142500 and shares many of its best characteristics, such as the induction motor, overall cleaning power, and sturdy design. But this model also has a number of differences, some of which we liked and others we weren’t fond of.
It’s very similar to our top pick. The DeWalt DWPW2400 has the same roll-bar design, with a padded handle and a low center of gravity. The clearly labeled nozzles are stored at the handle, and the cord has the same smart placement of the GFCI brick. The controls are intuitive, as are the connection points for the hoses. We didn’t notice any difference in cleaning power between the two.
In some ways, it’s better than our top pick from Ryobi. The detergent tank on this model is removable and translucent, solving all of the issues we have with the tank on our Ryobi top pick. The DeWalt DWPW2400 also comes with two more nozzles than the Ryobi RY142500 does, adding 25- and 40-degree tips, which are not essential but nice to have. In addition, the large, wide pneumatic (air-filled) tires made it easy for us to bounce this thing over rough terrain, including across a rocky, cratered area of lawn that had recently been dug up for planting.
But the cord storage and wand storage are not great. The cord storage is positioned very low, and with a 35-foot cord, wrapping up the entire length takes a while. Additionally, there’s so much cord that it just barely fits around the “horns” that you’re meant to wrap the cord around. It’s such a long (and annoying) process that we had to fully crouch down to avoid the onset of back pain when we tried to do this from a bent-over position. After a while, we started ignoring the horns and just bundled the cord with the hose and hung them both from the Velcro strap dangling from the handle. We also disliked how the DWPW2400’s wand holder hardly worked at all—the spray wand seemed to fall off every time we touched the washer.
It’s more expensive than the Ryobi model. Prices fluctuate, but on average, we’ve seen the DeWalt pressure washer selling for about $30 more than the Ryobi model. That isn’t a huge difference, but it exists, so unless you know that you’d benefit from the DeWalt model’s pneumatic tires, we suggest sticking with our pick from Ryobi.
Best budget pressure washer: Sun Joe SPX3000 Electric Pressure Washer
Budget pick
This less expensive model cleans comparably, but because it lacks several standout features, it’s much less convenient to use.
If you want a decent washer for the lowest price possible, we like the Sun Joe SPX3000 Electric Pressure Washer, one of the least expensive models we tested. It’s nowhere near as user-friendly as the Ryobi RY142500, but it cleans just as well, so if you’re planning to operate a pressure washer only once or twice each year and you cringe at the Ryobi model’s price tag, this Sun Joe washer will get the job done. It has some annoyances, but among the pressure washers in its price range, the Sun Joe SPX3000 stands apart for making fewer compromises than its competitors.
For a budget pressure washer, it gets a lot right. This Sun Joe washer has a metal spray wand (competitors’ wands at this price are often plastic) and comes with five removable nozzle tips: 0, 15, 25, and 40 degrees, plus soap. Unfortunately, it has no rotary nozzle, but it does have two detergent tanks. It has simple, effective cord and hose hooks, so we never had any issue with the hose or cord falling off while we were moving the washer.
But it has some serious limitations. Compared with the hose on our top pick from Ryobi, the Sun Joe SPX3000’s hose is 5 feet shorter, so encircling a car for washing, for example, is more difficult. The SPX3000 also has small wheels that don’t work well on a lawn—expect to do more carrying and dragging than all-terrain rolling. And this washer has a noisy universal motor, rather than an induction motor like the one on our top pick.
Overall, it lacks the general fit and finish of our top pick from Ryobi. This Sun Joe model doesn’t have a metal roll bar, it’s not as stable, the hose connections are just a little more difficult to make, the tip storage isn’t as good, and the GFCI brick is impossible to use in a covered exterior outlet unless you use an extension cord. These little annoyances—combined with the small wheel size, short hose length, and loud motor noise—can add up to a generally frustrating experience.
Best portable pressure washer: Ryobi RY1419MTVNM 1900 PSI Electric Pressure Washer
Also great
This Ryobi model doesn’t clean as quickly as the others, but its small size and top handle make it portable and easy to store.
For a less powerful but more portable option, we like the Ryobi RY1419MTVNM 1900 PSI Electric Pressure Washer. Although it has the same long hose and cord as our main pick from Ryobi, this smaller Ryobi washer is much easier to carry around and can be stowed away on a shelf. It lacks the premium induction motor of the Ryobi RY142500, so it may not last as long. Another downside is that the GFCI is at the cord end, so it will not work with covered exterior outlets.
It’s less than half the weight of our main pick. At about 20 pounds, the RY1419MTVNM is very easy to carry and store. You can pick it up with the top handle or roll it along on small, luggage-like wheels with the extending handle (we preferred carrying it).
It also has less power than the other models we tested. This smaller Ryobi model cleaned all the same things, but we had to hold its nozzle closer to the object and spend more time overall. When it comes to just getting things clean, we preferred the bigger Ryobi RY142500, but this model can still work, depending on your timing and technique.
Wirecutter supervising editor Joshua Lyon has been long-term testing the RY1419MTVNM for about a year, using it for around-the-house jobs like cleaning patio stones, siding, plastic Adirondack chairs, a wheelbarrow, and car tires, among other small chores. Aside from finding the act of pressure washing “ridiculously fun,” he told us that the Ryobi RY1419MTVNM’s power is more than enough for the work that he’s doing—he even stripped a little paint off his house when the nozzle got too close. Joshua appreciates the RY1419MTVNM’s compact size and has never used its luggage handle, preferring to just carry the washer around. “I don’t think I’d want to deal with a larger machine,” he said. “I find this one just right for easy storage in our smallish shed.”
Also great: DeWalt DWPW2100 2100 Max PSI Electric Jobsite Cold Water Pressure Washer
Also great
This DeWalt model isn’t as powerful as some other pressure washers, but with its unique shape and smart wand, hose, and cord storage, it’s the easiest one to stow away.
If storage is your primary concern—and with a rarely used item like a pressure washer, it might be—we recommend the DeWalt DWPW2100 2100 Max PSI Electric Jobsite Cold Water Pressure Washer. Everything about this model’s design is focused on making it easy to stow away. Its biggest flaw is that the hose is very stiff.
There’s a real satisfaction to storing it. Pressure washers take up a good amount of space—there is always a hose, a cord, and a spray wand flopping around, so even the small ones aren’t exactly neat, tidy packages. Every detail of the DWPW2100 is designed to reduce that frustration. All the parts and accessories are stored within the rectangular roll-bar frame. The cord tucks into one side and the hose in the other; the wand breaks down into three pieces and slides into a compartment on one side. The spray nozzles are stored on the handle of the spray wand. Because the end result is so perfectly boxy, the DeWalt DWPW2100 can store on its narrow end or have things stacked on top of it (something we’ve never seen in a pressure washer before).
It’s easy to maneuver around. Though the DeWalt DWPW2100 doesn’t have a big handle or big wheels, its easy-to-grab roll cage gives you a lot of options for carrying it, which ended up being our preferred method of moving the machine around. If that’s awkward for you, it also has a retractable handle and small wheels. The wheels are like in-line skate wheels and work far better than the small, plastic ones found on most pressure washers.
The sleek, storage-centered design comes at a cost. We got a lot done with this pressure washer, but its power is not in the same class as that of our top pick. Although it’s closer in power to the compact Ryobi model we recommend, its cost is within range of our top pick’s pricing. That puts it at about twice the price of other models with similar power, so you have quite a hefty cost increase for the easy storage.
What about cordless pressure washers?
Cordless pressure washers are a new category of tool, and this year we tested the latest models from Ego, Greenworks, and Ryobi. They’re good cleaners with nice features—the Ego model especially—but the downsides are that they are extremely expensive and have run times that aren’t fit for big jobs such as cleaning a large driveway or a mildew-covered bluestone patio. It’s nice that they’re untethered from an outlet, but since they remain tethered to a hose, the appeal of a cordless model—portability—is, in most cases, moot. It’s true that they come with a siphon hose in order to take water from an alternative source such as a bucket, lake, or stream, but the instances where that feature would come in handy are either rare or nonexistent for most people.
The best of the bunch is the Ego Power+ 3200 PSI Cordless Pressure Washer, which has several great features that we’d love to see on some of its more accessible competitors. It offers fantastic quick-connect fittings, handle-mounted controls, and three pressure options to help moderate cleaning power and water usage. At about $800, it’s nearly three times the cost of our corded pick. It comes with two batteries but only a single charger, so you can expect a lot of downtime if you’re taking on a large project.
The Greenworks 80V 3000-PSI Electric Pressure Washer and the Ryobi RY40306BTLVNM 40V HP Whisper Series 2000 PSI Pressure Washer are also nice. Although they don’t have all of the convenience features of the Ego model, they’re efficient at cleaning—while the battery lasts—and otherwise behave the way any pressure washer should. The Greenworks model comes with a dual-port battery charger, which we appreciated.
The competition
As of 2024, we’re no longer recommending gas pressure washers. They clean faster than electric models, but the trade-off is a tool that’s louder, heavier, and smellier. Gas-powered pressure washers also need fuel, oil, maintenance, and proper offseason storage. We’ve had one on hand for years, and we never use it, always reaching for an electric model instead. If you have a very large area that you consistently clean and you don’t mind maintaining an engine, we do like the gas-powered models from Ryobi (which are the ones we used to recommend). They have reliable Honda engines, offer nice convenience features, and are readily available at Home Depot. Our first choice would be the RY803023A 3100 PSI Gas Pressure Washer.
The Greenworks Pro GWP2700 2700 PSI Cold Water Electric Pressure Washer is as good as—and even better than—our picks in a lot of ways, but its main drawback is that the body of the washer has the handle orientation of a wheelbarrow, whereas our picks more resemble a two-wheeled dolly. That is, when this Greenworks washer is in a vertical position, the handle ends up over the front of the washer, not the back. So moving this model around on a flat surface such as a driveway or lawn is no problem, but getting it up a set of patio stairs or a curb is difficult—in fact, we had to fully lift it up each step, which was awkward due to how the handle sat and where the center of gravity was. In contrast, our picks from Ryobi and DeWalt just bumped right up a set of stairs with minimal difficulty.
The compact Chemical Guys ProFlow PM200 Performance Electric Pressure Washer is powerful little cleaner designed with the car detailer in mind (indicated in part by the included casters). We liked it, but since it has no onboard hose, cord, or wand storage, it doesn’t store as well as some of the others.
Most models, like the Ryobi RY142022VNM, the Kärcher K1700, and the Kärcher K1900, didn’t have our pick’s combination of features and cleaning power, nor its induction motor.
The AR BlueClean BC2N1HSS and the AR2N1 each have a two-part design in which you can separate the washer unit from the cart. For models priced similar to our pick, however, they fall short in that they lack an induction motor.
The Kärcher K5 is very similar to the now-discontinued K4 (which we tested). It’s a powerful pressure washer, but the convenience features weren’t as comprehensive as those of our pick.
Kärcher’s K3 Follow Me has an interesting four-wheel design that you can pull around behind you. Its low cleaning-units score and so-so owner feedback put it out of the running.
Other models, such as the AR Blue Clean AR383, AR Blue Clean’s AR383SS, and the Sun Joe SPX4600, were marred by subpar cord and hose storage.
Stanley’s electric pressure washers are all made by AR Blue Clean and appear to be the exact same, but with yellow paint instead of blue.
The Greenworks GPW2300 is similar to our Ryobi top pick and DeWalt runner-up, but it has smaller wheels, and we’ve seen availability issues with that company’s models.

The Best Robot Vacuums
Sabine Heinlein is a writer covering floor care. Keeping her multi-pet home clean is one of her more acceptable obsessions.
Robot vacuums are feats of engineering. Even a basic bot can keep your floors tidy with little effort on your part, handling pet hair and dust adeptly. Top-tier models can map your home, schedule cleanings, take voice commands, and empty themselves.
But don’t set your expectations too high. These machines excel in routine midweek cleanups but can’t replace traditional plug-in vacuums, especially on rugs. And even the fanciest models can drive you mad, getting tangled or trapped, or missing piles of dirt.
In our most recent testing, we tried 13 models, from cheap, aimless bumblers to sophisticated machines that (usually) navigate with ease. We think that the Roborock Q5 Max+, with its self-emptying dock, and the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max are your best choices. (If you’re curious about hybrid models that can vacuum and mop, we have some information on those, too.)
Everything we recommend
Top pick
This bot is a top-notch cleaner and a great navigator that avoids (most) obstacles while keeping on top of scattered debris. It comes with a charging dock that sucks debris from its dustbin after it cleans.
Budget pick
This solid, affordable robot vacuum has a large bin and excellent cleaning power. It can be scheduled to clean, but it can’t be controlled with an app.
How we tested
- Cleaning power
We measured and compared how much debris each model picked up.
- Intelligence
We checked how well each model performed around obstacles and took note of the user-friendliness of app-controlled bots.
- Convenience
We checked each bot’s noise level, whether it moved easily under and around furniture, and whether its brushes could tackle corners.
- Sustainability
We checked whether a model could be repaired and whether replacement parts are easily available.
Top pick
This bot is a top-notch cleaner and a great navigator that avoids (most) obstacles while keeping on top of scattered debris. It comes with a charging dock that sucks debris from its dustbin after it cleans.
The Roborock Q5 Max+ was one of the most thorough cleaners we tested, picking up more debris than some costlier models. It’s one of the best navigators we’ve tried, able to map multiple levels of your home and remember a room’s layout.
This model’s user-friendly app offers dozens of customizations, such as scheduling cleaning cycles, vacuuming specific rooms, and sending the bot back to places it may have missed. It also allows you to block off areas that you don’t want cleaned.
While Roborock’s obstacle-detection system isn’t perfect, the Q5 Max+ avoided hurdles more effectively than the other robots we tested. It’s also one of the quietest robots we’ve tried, which comes in handy if you have skittish pets or are easily distracted. It comes with a charging station that can suck debris from the robot right into a large, disposable bag.
The Q5 Max+ has a one-year warranty.
Budget pick
This solid, affordable robot vacuum has a large bin and excellent cleaning power. It can be scheduled to clean, but it can’t be controlled with an app.
In our cleaning tests, the basic Eufy RoboVac 11S Max outperformed even robots with fancy navigation, sucking up more debris than most, including along baseboards and close to walls. Its low height allows it to effortlessly glide under furniture to pick up dust bunnies and missed kitty treats.
The 11S Max is so quiet and nimble that it fades into the background like no other robot we’ve tested. It doesn’t connect to an app, but it does come with a remote control for scheduling it to clean and directing it to missed spots. But its navigation system tends to be random, and its bumbling aimlessness gets on some people’s nerves.
It comes with a one-year warranty.
The research
Why you should trust us
Staff writer Sabine Heinlein has been a journalist for over two decades. She obsesses over how to remove fur from every corner of her home and hairballs from her heirloom rugs.
We’ve tested dozens of robot vacuums since 2012, including 13 models in 2023. We spent more than 80 hours examining the robot vacuums and testing the top contenders in a multi-pet, multistory, multi-surface home.
For this guide, we interviewed representatives from companies that make robot vacuums, including iRobot, Roborock, and Ecovacs. We pored over owner reviews and talked to robot-vacuum owners. We also employed the AI tool FindOurView to identify important themes and issues in thousands of customer reviews.
Who this is for
Anyone who wants to keep their floors looking clean can benefit from a robot vacuum. If you’re short on time, have mobility or dexterity issues, or simply hate vacuuming, a robot vacuum can probably make your life easier.
Bots don’t procrastinate or get bored, so they spend more time cleaning. Pet owners and people with young kids in particular seem to gain a lot from bots, and many robot-vacuum owners have told us that they are amazed at how clean their floors look and feel after they start using one regularly.
However, while a robot vacuum is great at cleaning superficially, it has only a fraction of the suction power of a good upright or canister vacuum. Bots make great secondary options, but even the most expensive ones leave much to be desired: They fail to remove dirt embedded deep in carpets and rugs, and they often neglect dust close to baseboards and thresholds. While obstacle-avoidance technology has improved in recent years, don’t rely on your robot to avoid getting tangled up in cords, toys, and socks. You’ll still have to tidy up before you start your cleaner.
How we picked and tested
We tested 15 robot vacuums in 2023 and 2024. Here’s what we evaluated:
Cleaning performance: For every robot vacuum we tested, we ran at least three regular cleaning cycles across a 600-square-foot space with furniture, obstacles, thresholds, and a couple of low-to-medium-pile area rugs. We evenly spread a mix of rice, cat litter, and Cheerios around the living room, hallway, and kitchen. We weighed each bot’s dustbin before and after the cleaning cycle to determine how much debris it had collected. We also checked how each bot coped with rabbit and cat fur, litter, and strands of hay, and we sprinkled a tablespoon of baking soda alongside baseboards to see how much it was able to gather. We also noted whether a robot’s self-emptying dock worked as intended.
Obstacle navigation: We noted whether the robot was able to climb the 0.75-inch threshold to the bathroom, how often it got tripped up by obstacles, and whether it elicited certain failure messages repeatedly.
App and voice controls: Where pertinent, we assessed the user-friendliness of the model’s app and checked whether its features were useful and functioning properly. Where applicable, we assessed a test model’s compatibility with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home.
Repairability and reliability: We collect long-term data from the owners of our picks and, if applicable, look at data from the AI-assisted user-review analysis tool FindOurView.
In addition, we long-term test all of our picks in a variety of households, sometimes for years or more, to determine durability and performance. We also checked whether replacement parts, such as battery packs and brushes, are easily available and affordable.
Top pick: Roborock Q5 Max+
Top pick
This bot is a top-notch cleaner and a great navigator that avoids (most) obstacles while keeping on top of scattered debris. It comes with a charging dock that sucks debris from its dustbin after it cleans.
If your pets shed like they’re planning to join a nudist colony or your kid is a human Cheerios cannon, a robot vacuum is a great sidekick to a more powerful plug-in model. The Roborock Q5 Max + ranked among the most thorough and quietest cleaners we tested, and they have useful smart features and mapping technology to boot. This model comes with a dock that automatically empties its dustbin into a bag.
It’s an excellent cleaner. In our tests, the Q5 Max+ cleaned better than any other smart robot at its price, sucking up almost 90% of the rice, Cheerios, fur, and baking soda we put down.
It’s an adroit, speedy navigator. Using its laser rangefinder (lidar) and bump sensors, the Q5 Max+ learns your floor plan in a swift, single session. In our tests, it quickly mapped the home before embarking on its cleaning run, which took about half the time of that of many other robot vacuums.
It can avoid obstacles and cross (some) thresholds. In our tests, even when the Q5 Max+ bumped into an object its lidar turret missed, it course-corrected faster and more accurately than other bots.
While you can’t expect this model to run up the stairs, it climbed a 0.75-inch bathroom threshold that most other bots didn’t even attempt to cross over. In our tests, only the iRobot Roomba 694 and the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max (sometimes) made it from the hallway into the bathroom.
It has a great app and useful smart features. Roborock’s app lets you map your home faster and more accurately than those of most other smart bots we tested. It is user-friendly and intuitive, and it can store up to four maps of your home in both 2D and 3D. The app also lets you turn on spot cleaning (to get rid of isolated spills) and auto-boost mode (for fur-covered carpets, for instance), as well as schedule cleaning sessions.
It is equipped with a remote control and a “Pin n Go” function, which makes it easy to direct the robot toward spots it may have missed. (We have, for example, used it in our baking soda/baseboard test.)
Compatible with Siri, Alexa, and Google Home, Roborock’s app generally responds well to voice commands—as long as you pronounce Roborock like Robo Rock, a common complaint among users. For example, you can say “Hey Alexa, send Robo Rock to vacuum the dining room,” and off it goes.
It has a long run time—and it cleans quietly. The Q5 Max+’s battery lasts for 240 minutes when used on bare floors in quiet mode. If the Q5 Max+ encounters the resistance of carpets and is run on Turbo or Max mode, its run time will reduce significantly but will still be enough to vacuum a 1,500-square-foot home. While we had to cover our ears and watch our pets bolt when the iRobot Roombas ran or emptied their bins, the Q5 Max+’s emptying dock was comparably quiet.
Its self-emptying dock actually works. Unlike that of the iRobot Roomba i4+ and j9+, the Q5 Max+’s self-emptying dock sucked in even heavy and large debris, such as rice and Cheerios, leaving nothing behind in the robot’s bin. The dock holds a 2.5-liter bag for dry debris, and it needs to be exchanged by hand once it’s full.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
It misses spots. Like almost all bots we tested, the Roborock Q5 Max+ struggled with debris close to thresholds and baseboards. (Only the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max and the Miele Scout RX3 did markedly better.) In our tests, the Roborock Q5 Max+ spread cat litter and rice alongside a 0.375-inch rug and a 0.25-inch door threshold because its suction wasn’t enough to pick up debris when one wheel was on the rug or threshold and the other wheel was on the bare floor. We noticed that, in some instances, its brush kicked even more debris toward the transition. Similar to most robot vacuums, its effectiveness in removing fine dust from the edges of a room is lacking.
Roborock’s customer service appears inconsistent. An alarming number of Amazon reviews report frustration about Roborock’s customer service. When we called their helpline, however, our call was promptly answered. We were put on a five-minute hold while a courteous representative researched our dilemma.
It offers an industry-standard one-year warranty, but few replacement parts. While users can replace their Q5 Max+’s washable filters, brush, charging cable, and dustbin, unlike Eufy (and iRobot), Roborock doesn’t offer replacement motors, and while its batteries can be replaced, the company advises to call customer service first.
Budget pick: Eufy RoboVac 11S Max
Budget pick
This solid, affordable robot vacuum has a large bin and excellent cleaning power. It can be scheduled to clean, but it can’t be controlled with an app.
The simple, affordable Eufy RoboVac 11S Max cleans almost as well as the pricier Roborock Q5 Max+, but it lacks a dock, mapping technology, and other smart features.
It cleans well and has a large bin. In our tests, the RoboVac 11S Max effortlessly removed rice, Cheerios, cat litter, and even baking soda sprinkled close to baseboards (a rarity among even the most expensive robot models). The 11S Max has one side brush (the model we originally tested, the 11S, had two). During testing, this vacuum efficiently ferreted out an unholy amount of fur from the carpet and swept the whole batch into its large, 600-milliliter dustbin.
In our tests, it performed better close to thresholds and around rugs than any other bot, except for the much pricier Miele Scout RX3.
It’s quiet and relatively nimble. The 11S Max is so quiet, you could easily forget that it’s running. It skips over half-inch door thresholds (and, in our tests, it occasionally made it over the 0.75-inch threshold to the bathroom), and it is supposed to avoid stairs and drops. (We had several incidents where the 11S and the 11S Max fell down a flight of stairs, presumably because its drop sensors were dirty.)
With its anti-collision sensors, this model stays clear of most obstacles. In fact, we found that it didn’t get tangled up any more often than the Roborock Q5 Max+. (The Q5 Max+’s advantage is that the app sends out an alert if it gets stuck, making it harder to miss such situations. The 11S Max will just keep trying to free itself until it runs out of juice.)
In our test home, the 11S Max’s low height of 2.85 inches allowed it to smoothly glide under every piece of furniture. (The Roborock Q5 Max+ is one inch taller, so it may not be able to slip under low sofas or beds.)
It has three cleaning modes and a decently long run time. The 11S Max has three cleaning modes: Standard, Maximum, and Boost IQ. The latter automatically switches from standard to maximum mode on carpets. Its battery lasts for 100 minutes, as measured on bare floors in Standard mode). In a home with carpets and rugs, a runtime of 60 minutes is more realistic.
It lacks an app but has an old-fashioned remote control. The 11S Max doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi, so it can’t create maps of your home or be controlled via an app. But it does come with a battery-powered remote control that lets you schedule cleaning cycles and direct it to spots it may have missed.
It’s durable. Guide author Sabine Heinlein has had her Eufy 11S (the predecessor of the Eufy 11S Max) for almost four years and had to replace its battery only recently. She’s run it several times a week in a very furry household and is continuously impressed with its pickup. Senior editor Grant Clauser and senior staff writer Rachel Cericola have also owned earlier models of the Eufy 11S Max for five-plus years, and their bots are still going strong. “Twice I had to completely open it up to clean out dust and dog hair that was preventing it from running,” Grant said, “but other than that, I just replace the filters and brush once a year.”
It’s got an average warranty, good customer service, and lots of replaceable parts. Like our top pick, the 11S Max comes with a one-year warranty. But unlike our top pick, almost all the parts of the 11S Max are replaceable. Eufy sells replacement brushes, brush guards, bumpers, battery packs, charging stations, motors, filters, and more on its website, making the 11S Max a more sustainable choice than other models we tested.
Eufy’s customer service generally gets excellent ratings from Amazon reviewers. When we called, we waited for 10 minutes before choosing the callback option. Our call was returned within the hour and our questions were answered.
What to look forward to
We’re currently testing the iRobot Roomba Vac Essential Robot (available on Amazon as the Q0120 and the Q011, which comes with an extra filter); it follows in the footsteps of iRobot’s 600 series but has higher suction power and app compatibility. We’re also planning to test the forthcoming iRobot Roomba Vac 2 Essential Robot, with auto-empty dock, which is now available for preorder and will ship in mid-November. We will update this guide with our testing results.
The competition
This is not a comprehensive list of everything we tested in previous iterations of this guide—only models that we’ve recently tested and are currently available.
We tested the Dyson 360 Vis Nav and were less than impressed. It didn’t clean any better than our budget pick, the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max, despite costing four times as much. While it boasts several nifty features, such as a carrying handle and a “side duct” that redirects suction to capture dust and debris close to baseboards and furniture, it has too short a run time and suffers from too many glitches for a robot priced at $1,200.
If you were to judge a robot vacuum by its appearance and cleaning performance alone, the Miele Scout RX3 Home Vision would be the clear winner. With the looks of a charming axolotl, the Miele RX3 was the only model that consistently cleaned baking soda close to baseboards and in corners. It is extremely quiet, and while its no-frills app is intuitive, it lacks many of Roborock’s features. Its built-in live camera transmits a grainy image feed to your app, supposedly so you can keep an eye on your home. The bot also gets easily caught even on low thresholds, frequently eliciting a “wheel raised” error code. The RX3 is supposedly compatible with Alexa, but it leaves much to be desired, and Amazon users in Germany, where the “Saugroboter” has been available for over two years, are livid. (We learned, by calling customer service, that Miele doesn’t even provide a list with suitable voice commands.) In our tests, it responded to only two commands—start and stop—despite numerous attempts to get it to vacuum specific rooms. (It did somewhat better with Google Home.) One would expect a $900 vacuum cleaner to be closer to perfection.
We liked the TP-Link Tapo RV30C. Its app is easy to use, but it didn’t clean as well as our picks, leaving behind more debris around thresholds than its competitors. Plus, its high-pitched sound can be grating.
We also tested the Eufy RoboVac 15C Max, but it wasn’t nearly as good a cleaner as the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max.
The Shark RV2310AE Matrix is just okay. While it is excellent at scaling thresholds, it tended to kick debris around, and it returned to its dock despite having missed several large areas.
The Eureka E10S is almost ridiculously bad. Our review unit talked incessantly and cleaned shamefully, and we encountered a different type of problem with each run. At first it spoke only Russian, even though we had the country set to the United States (weirdly, the language function is hidden somewhere within the mapping feature). Then, after mapping the home, it failed to find its base. Lastly, it obsessed over an obstacle-free 4-square-foot area for 15 minutes straight. A company representative told us that several of these issues have been rectified, though we remain hesitant to recommend this model.
Why we don’t currently recommend vacuums from iRobot
In our latest testing cycle, we evaluated the iRobot Roomba 694, the iRobot Roomba i4 EVO (and i4+ EVO, with a self-emptying dock), and the iRobot Roomba j9+. We also tested one of iRobot’s new vacuum-mop hybrids, the iRobot Roomba Combo i5+.
(The company has been in the news: Amazon canceled its planned acquisition of iRobot in early 2024, and iRobot has announced that it will be cutting 350 jobs.)
Each iRobot vacuum presented its own set of challenges and caveats.
Roomba 694: Previously one of our budget picks, the 694 was outperformed by our new budget pick, the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max. The Roomba 694 collected only between a third to a half of the debris that the 11S Max managed to pick up, and its dustbin is considerably smaller than that of the 11S Max.
Roomba i4/i4+ EVO: The Roomba i4 EVO and i4+ EVO (with a self-emptying dock) were former top picks in this guide. Though iRobot has discontinued the i4 EVO and i4+ EVO, they’re still available on Amazon and at some other retailers.
Under the right circumstances, the i4 is a great, relatively inexpensive cleaner. But the first i4 EVO unit we tried in this testing cycle fell short in its app functionality, especially when compared to the less expensive Roborock Q5 Max+, which maps significantly faster and whose app offers more features. Both the i4 EVO and i4+ EVO initially struggled to connect to Wi-Fi, with the app crashing occasionally, and it took them more than three times as long to map than the Roborock Q5. Furthermore, the i4 repeatedly failed to save the map it had created.
Company representatives told us that they were not aware this was a common problem. But our analysis of Amazon reviews using FindOurView indicated that up to a third of reviewers complained of mapping issues, including the amount of time it takes to map, unsaved maps, and inaccurate mapping.
The i4+ EVO’s self-emptying dock also failed to remove all the debris it had collected in its bin, leaving behind Cheerios and rice.
Roomba j9+: The j9+ cleaned well, but like the i4+ EVO, its self-emptying dock didn’t consistently remove all the debris from the bot’s bin. Our contact at iRobot attributed this to the Cheerios in our tests, but we noticed similar issues with other, smaller debris, such as rice. The j9+ also frequently bumped into furniture and pushed over a large cup, one of the obstacles we had put in its path.
Roomba Combo i5+: One of iRobot’s newest models, the Combo i5+ comes with two separate, exchangeable bins, one for mopping and one for vacuuming.
We faced multiple problems during testing. Initial Wi-Fi connectivity issues were followed by app crashes, and as with the i4 EVO and i4+EVO, the mapping process seemed endless, and its supposedly self-emptying dock consistently failed to fully empty the debris bin.
A major issue occurred when the app didn’t automatically offer a mopping mode, which requires the scanning of a separate, easy-to-miss QR code, leading the dock to inadvertently suck dirty water into its vacuum bag. We reached out to customer service, which couldn’t solve and therefore escalated the issue. But resolution was slow and came only after we contacted iRobot’s PR team. (iRobot says it has since resolved the issue, and no separate QR code is needed anymore.) Apparently, we weren’t the only ones with this problem.
Complaints about iRobot’s customer service are rampant, reflecting a broader issue with its app and product support.
Though eventually operational, the i5+ mopped ineffectively, leaving behind stains that could easily be removed with a regular mop. The bot also repeatedly returned to its dock before it had finished cleaning, and its slanted tray leaked water onto the floor overnight.
What about robot vacuum-mop combos?
Over the past year or so, dozens of new robot vacuum-mop combos have hit the market. These machines, made by companies like Roborock, iRobot, Ecovacs, and Eufy, claim to be do-it-all wonders that can clean up any mess, wet or dry.
We recently tested 16 of them, and we failed to find a model that we’d wholeheartedly recommend over a standalone robot vacuum and a good wet mop.
We found that these combos didn’t mop edges well. They also balked at dried-on stains and generally suffered from the same faults as robot vacuums, including having trouble gathering debris close to thresholds and running over obstacles. And despite their ability to raise their mops when encountering carpet, we found that they often wet carpet edges.
They also require a fair amount of maintenance, so they’re hardly hands-off: The dirty-water tank has to be cleaned out after each mopping session, the dust bag has to be exchanged at least monthly, and the mop pads still have to be laundered occasionally.
And many of the better-performing models cost over $1,000.
That said, we have hopes for the category, and it’s clear that companies are investing heavily in developing robot vacuum-mop combos. We’re keeping our eyes on new releases, including those from new companies like Matic, which is working on a combo bot with a higher-functioning brain that mimics human perception, according to company co-founder Mehul Nariyawala.
Care and maintenance
Before you start a cleaning session, you should pick up any laundry, charging cables, or lightweight mats. (Expect a few hiccups during the first handful of sessions until you figure out the pain points.)
It’s normal for a robot to not re-dock from time to time. But if that happens consistently, try moving the dock. For bump-and-run bots, it’s a good strategy to keep the dock near the middle of your home (rather than stuffed in the corner in a back room) so that the bot will cross the dock’s path more often. For all bots, be sure to leave a few feet open around and above the dock. If the dock is in a cluttered area or under a piece of furniture, there’s a good chance the bot will not re-dock.
In most homes, a bot is likely to stay in good shape if you maintain it properly in the following ways:
- Shake off the filter every few sessions.
- Wash (Q5 Max+) or replace (11S Max) the filter every few dozen sessions. You could save some money by using third-party filters, which are unlikely to harm the bot, but you may void your warranty if you happen to send in your bot for repairs with one of them in the filter slot.
- Cut away any hair wrapped around the brush roll as necessary. Most bots come with a tool that can cut and then brush away the fuzz.
- Clean the bearings on the brush roll, caster, and side brushes every few weeks (more often if you have pets). You might need a screwdriver for this job, but many bots let you pop out the parts with no tools.
- Wipe the sensors clean as needed, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
- Keep a can of compressed air handy in case you need to blow dust out of gears or other hard-to-reach nooks in the bot.
- Replace filters and side brushes a few times per year, the brush roll about once a year, and the battery (if available) as needed.
If your bot breaks down outside of the warranty period, you may be able to repair it, particularly if it’s a Eufy model. Don’t chalk up the bot as a total loss until you check to see whether the broken part is available as a replacement.

Frequently asked questions
Do robot vacuums really work?
Yes. Although robot vacuums are weaker than traditional vacuums, they can reliably pick up most kinds of floor debris, and they work on most bare floors and carpets.
Do robot vacuums need Wi-Fi?
No. Although many robot vacuums do connect to Wi-Fi so that you can control them remotely via an app or receive software updates, most bots also have physical controls. (Note that you need to connect your bot to Wi-Fi if you want to use features like smart mapping or voice control.) Some, like the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max, don’t connect to Wi-Fi at all.
How often should I run my robot vacuum?
The advantage of a robot vacuum is that it can clean floors more often than many people are willing to vacuum. If you schedule it to run every few days, or even every day, dust and crumbs won’t accumulate, leaving your floors feeling cleaner than they would without a bot.
Do any robot vacuums empty themselves?
Many manufacturers now offer the option of robot vacuums with and without self-emptying docks. Self-emptying robot vacuums come with a big charging dock that sucks debris out of the robot through a trapdoor in the dustbin and stores it in a disposable bag or a bagless bin. You still have to toss the bag or empty the bin regularly.
The charging stations are big, noisy, and kind of ugly, but the system saves you from having to empty the dustbin on the robot every time you vacuum. Bagged machines also make for better filtration, as the debris remains contained in a bag, and you don’t have to inhale any of it when emptying the bin.
